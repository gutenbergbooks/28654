<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dave Porter and the Runaways</span>&#8221; is a
complete story in itself, but forms the ninth
volume of a line issued under the general title of
&#8220;Dave Porter Series.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the first volume of this series, entitled
&#8220;Dave Porter at Oak Hall,&#8221; the reader was introduced
to a typical American lad, and the particulars
were given of his doings at an up-to-date
boarding school.</p>
<p>There was a cloud over Dave&#8217;s parentage, and
in order to solve the mystery of his identity he
took a long voyage over the ocean, as related in
the second volume, called &#8220;Dave Porter in the
South Seas.&#8221; Then he came back to his schoolmates,
as told of in &#8220;Dave Porter&#8217;s Return to
School,&#8221; and then took a long trip to Norway, to
hunt up his father, the particulars of which are
given in &#8220;Dave Porter in the Far North.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having settled the matter of his identity to his
satisfaction, our hero came back to Oak Hall and
had a number of strenuous contests, related in
detail in &#8220;Dave Porter and His Classmates.&#8221;
Following this came the summer vacation, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_iv' name='page_iv'></a>iv</span>
the youth made a trip West, the happenings of
which are set down in &#8220;Dave Porter at Star
Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Dave returned to Oak Hall once more
he found the school rivalries as bitter as ever, and
what these led to has been related in &#8220;Dave
Porter and His Rivals.&#8221; His enemies tried hard
to do our hero much injury, but he exposed them
and they were forced to flee, to escape the consequences
of their actions.</p>
<p>The winter holidays found Dave homeward
bound. He had anticipated some jolly times
among his relatives and friends, but a robbery
upset all his plans, and, almost before he knew
it, he found himself bound southward, as related
in &#8220;Dave Porter on Cave Island.&#8221; On the
island he had many adventures out of the ordinary,
and he came home more of a hero than
ever, having saved Mr. Wadsworth, his benefactor,
from ruin.</p>
<p>In the present story Dave is back once again
at school. There are some queer happenings,
and then some lads run away. How Dave
proved his common sense, and brought the runaways
back, I leave for the pages which follow
to tell. I trust the reading of this volume will
do all my young friends good.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>DAVE AND HIS CHUMS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I say, Dave, here&#8217;s an odd piece of news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An odd piece of news, Roger? What
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wild man in the woods back of Oak Hall,&#8221;
answered Roger Morr, who held a letter in his
hand. &#8220;Queerest thing you ever heard of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say it was, if it&#8217;s about a wild man,&#8221;
returned Dave Porter. &#8220;Who sent that letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shadow Hamilton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s another one of Shadow&#8217;s innumerable
yarns,&#8221; suggested Dave, with a faint smile.
&#8220;If he can&#8217;t tell them by word of mouth, he writes
them down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has Shadow got to say about the wild
man?&#8221; asked Phil Lawrence, looking up from
the suit-case he was packing. &#8220;Has he been trying
to clean out Oak Hall, or anything like that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, not exactly,&#8221; returned Roger, turning
back to the letter, which he had not yet finished.
&#8220;He keeps in the woods, so Shadow says, and
scares everybody who comes that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does he scare them?&#8221; asked Dave, pausing
in the act of stowing a suit of clothing in a
trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shadow writes that he and Lazy were out
walking one day and the wild man came after
them with a big club. He wears long hair and
a long beard, and his clothes are in tatters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they do?&#8221; questioned Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ran back towards the school. The wild
man followed &#8217;em as far as the bridge over the
brook, and then jumped into the bushes and disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; muttered Phil. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! The day before that, Chip Macklin
and two other of the smaller boys went out, along
the river, and the wild man came after them and
shoved Chip into the water. He yelled to them
never to come near him again. The other fellows
ran away, and as soon as Chip could get out of
the water he went after &#8217;em. Then, three days
later, Doctor Clay sent out Mr. Dale and Horsehair,
the driver, to look into the matter, and the
wild man met them at the bridge and threw mud
balls at &#8217;em. One mud ball hit the teacher in the
arm, and one struck Horsehair in the nose and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
made it bleed. Horsehair was afraid to go on,
because the wild man jumped around and shouted
so furiously. Mr. Dale tried to catch him, but
he ran away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor chap! He must be crazy,&#8221; was Dave&#8217;s
comment. &#8220;He ought to be taken care of by the
authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but they can&#8217;t catch him,&#8221; continued
Roger. &#8220;They have tried half a dozen ways, but
he slips &#8217;em every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; asked Dave, as he continued to
pack his trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody has the least idea, so Shadow
writes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that will give us something to do&mdash;when
we get back to Oak Hall!&#8221; cried Phil. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
organize a posse to round up the wild man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll have plenty of other things to
do when we get to school, Phil,&#8221; remarked Dave.
&#8220;Just remember that we have lost a lot of time
from our lessons, and if we want to make up
what we have missed, and graduate from Oak
Hall with honor, we&#8217;ve got to buckle down and
study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know that,&#8221; answered Phil, and gave a
little sigh. &#8220;Just the same, I&#8217;m going to have a
try at the wild man&mdash;if he comes my way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; cried Roger. &#8220;And Dave will try
with us; won&#8217;t you, old man?&#8221; And Roger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
caught his chum affectionately by the shoulder.
&#8220;You are the fellow to solve mysteries!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave was about to answer when there came a
knock on the bedroom door. He opened it to
find himself confronted by a middle-aged lady,
who was smiling but anxious.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you getting along, boys?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;First-rate, Mrs. Wadsworth,&#8221; answered
Roger. &#8220;We&#8217;ll soon be finished now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the girls getting anxious?&#8221; questioned
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what do you think?&#8221; burst out Phil.
&#8220;We are going back to Oak Hall to capture a
wild man who&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil!&#8221; burst out both Dave and Roger,
and the other youth stopped short in confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;A wild man?&#8221; cried the lady of the house, in
consternation. &#8220;Oh, Dave, I hope&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let him worry you, Mrs. Wadsworth,&#8221;
responded Dave, quickly. &#8220;There is a
wild man up there, but I don&#8217;t think he will bother
us any, and we&#8217;ve got too much to do to hunt for
him.&#8221; And the lad gave his chum a look that said
as plainly as words: &#8220;What did you want to
mention it for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I was only fooling,&#8221; stammered
Phil. &#8220;Of course, if there is a wild man he won&#8217;t
come near us. Tell the girls we&#8217;ll be ready in five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
minutes&mdash;at least I will,&#8221; he added, and resumed
his packing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I do anything for you?&#8221; asked the lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might try to find my striped cap,&#8221; answered
Dave. &#8220;I can&#8217;t seem to locate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in the library&mdash;I saw it a while ago,
Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And my baseball bat&mdash;the new one with the
black handle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is in the back hall, in a corner. How
about your books?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got all of them. Send Laura with the bat
and cap, will you, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes;&#8221; and Mrs. Wadsworth hurried off,
anxious to be of all the assistance possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that was a bad break for me,&#8221; murmured
Phil, as the door closed, and before Dave or
Roger could speak. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to worry her,
Dave. I&#8217;m sorry I mentioned the wild man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the man may be caught before we get
back to Oak Hall,&#8221; said Roger. He crossed the
room and peered into a closet. &#8220;Has anybody
seen my baseball shoes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You left those at the Hall, Roger,&#8221; answered
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I? All right, then. I came away in such
a hurry I can&#8217;t remember what I took and what I
didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve got about everything now,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
resumed Dave, looking around the bedroom.
He glanced at his watch. &#8220;Ten minutes to twelve.
We are to have lunch at a quarter past, and start
at one, sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Provided the auto is ready,&#8221; interposed Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be&mdash;trust my Uncle Dunston for that,&#8221;
answered Dave. &#8220;My, but isn&#8217;t it jolly to think
we are going back to school in the auto instead of
by train!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and to think that the girls and your uncle
are going with us!&#8221; added Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, look out for Roger, he&#8217;s got his eye on
Laura!&#8221; said Phil, slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you give us a rest, Phil Lawrence!&#8221;
burst out Roger, growing red. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve
got an eye on her yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor me! Poor me!&#8221; murmured Phil, as if
talking to himself. &#8220;Roger will talk to nobody
but Laura, and Dave will see and hear and think
of nobody but Jessie, and I&#8217;ll be left in the cold!
Oh, what a cruel world this is! If only&mdash;wow!&#8221;
and Phil&#8217;s pretended musings came to a sudden
end, as Dave shied a pair of rolled-up socks at
him and Roger followed with a pillow. In another
instant a mimic battle was on, with pillows
and various articles of clothing for ammunition.
Then came another knock on the door and Laura
Porter appeared, with a baseball bat in one hand
and her brother&#8217;s cap in the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear me!&#8221; she cried, and then stopped
short, for a red sweater, thrown by Roger at Phil,
had missed its aim and landed on her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Laura, really I do!&#8221;
gasped Roger, as he sprang forward and took
the sweater from its resting-place. &#8220;I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t
mean that for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Roger, of course you did!&#8221; cried Phil,
with a twinkle in his eye. &#8220;That&#8217;s the way he
salutes girls always, Laura.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the way you are packing up?&#8221; demanded
Dave&#8217;s sister, with a little smile, while
poor Roger grew redder than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we were only waiting for you to bring
my things, Laura,&#8221; answered her brother, coolly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be ready in three minutes and a half by
the factory whistles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what is this I hear about a wild man?&#8221;
continued Laura, as she sat down on a chair
Roger shoved towards her. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made Mrs.
Wadsworth and Jessie all excited over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t anything,&#8221; burst out Phil, quickly.
&#8220;I made a mistake even to mention it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She came down and told Jessie and me that
she was afraid you&#8217;d have more trouble, when you
got back to school. As if you haven&#8217;t had troubles
enough already!&#8221; And Laura looked affectionately
at her brother, and then at his chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this won&#8217;t amount to anything, Laura,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
said Dave. &#8220;So tell Mrs. Wadsworth and Jessie
not to worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to know what it means?&#8221; demanded
the sister; and in the end Dave and his
chums had to relate what they knew about the
wild man. As they finished the girl shook her
head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that a bit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am sure
you&#8217;ll get mixed up with that wild man somehow.
Why, he might attack you and try to kill
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be on our guard&mdash;when we go near the
woods,&#8221; answered Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better not go alone,&#8221; insisted the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seldom travel alone,&#8221; said her brother.
&#8220;Generally Roger, Phil, and I are together, and
very often some of the other fellows are with us.
But don&#8217;t you worry, Laura, and tell Jessie and
her mother it will be all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is another thing to be careful
about, Dave,&#8221; went on Laura, as she prepared to
leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful of how you treat Nat Poole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean?&#8221; cried Dave, and
then he added quickly, as he saw that his sister
had something on her mind: &#8220;What has happened
now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly, Dave. But I got word
through Ben Basswood&#8217;s cousin that Nat had
told Ben he wasn&#8217;t going to let you ride over
him this term. I think Nat is jealous because
you were so successful in that trip to Cave
Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you learn of anything Nat intended to
do?&#8221; questioned Roger, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, excepting that he said he wasn&#8217;t going
to play second fiddle to your crowd any longer.
He tried to get into a quarrel with Ben, but Ben
would have nothing to do with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Nat go back to the Hall when it
opened?&#8221; asked Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the same day Ben went back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of Nat Poole,&#8221; declared
Dave, stoutly. &#8220;He is a bully, always was, and
I suppose he always will be. I tried to do him a
favor the last time I saw him&mdash;but he doesn&#8217;t
seem to have appreciated it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laura!&#8221; called a musical voice, from the
stair landing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming, Jessie!&#8221; answered Laura. &#8220;Now
you boys, hurry&mdash;lunch will be served in a few
minutes;&#8221; and she left the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Nat Poole wants to make more trouble,
eh?&#8221; mused Dave, as he resumed packing.
&#8220;What a chap he is! Why can&#8217;t he be decent and
mind his own business?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because he isn&#8217;t that breed, that&#8217;s why,&#8221; answered
Phil. &#8220;He hates to see another fellow
become popular. Dave, you take my advice and
watch him, when we get back to school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; answered Dave, thoughtfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A GLIMPSE AT THE PAST</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Everything ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so far as I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we are off! Good-by, everybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by! Take care of yourself, Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a tooting of an automobile horn, a
chorus of cries and cheers, a waving of caps, and
then the big touring car that had been drawn up
in front of the Wadsworth mansion rolled from
the piazza steps through the spacious grounds;
and Dave Porter and his chums were once more
on their way to boarding school.</p>
<p>To those who have read the previous volumes
of this line of stories Dave Porter will need no
special introduction. For the benefit of new readers
allow me to state that Dave was a wideawake
American lad, now well along in his school years.</p>
<p>When a small child our hero had been found
one day, walking along the railroad tracks near
the town of Crumville. He could tell nothing
about himself, and as nobody came to claim him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
he was taken to the local poorhouse, where he
remained a number of years. Then he was bound
out to a broken-down college professor named
Caspar Potts, who was farming for his health.
The professor did what he could for the lad, but
soon got into difficulties with a mean money-lender
named Aaron Poole, and would have lost his farm
had it not been for something out of the ordinary
happening.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of the town lived a wealthy
jewelry manufacturer, Oliver Wadsworth. Mr.
Wadsworth had a daughter named Jessie, and
one day, through an explosion of an automobile
tank, the little miss was in danger of being burned
to death, when Dave came to her assistance. This
so pleased the Wadsworths that they came not
only to the boy&#8217;s aid but also helped Caspar Potts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lad shall go to boarding school and get
a good education,&#8221; said Oliver Wadsworth. And
how Dave was sent off has already been related
in the first book of this series, entitled &#8220;Dave
Porter at Oak Hall.&#8221; At the school he made
many warm friends, including Roger Morr, the
son of a United States senator; Phil Lawrence,
the offspring of a wealthy shipowner; Buster
Beggs, who was fat as he was jolly, and Maurice,
otherwise &#8220;Shadow&#8221; Hamilton, who would
rather spin yarns than eat. He also made some
enemies, not the least of whom were Gus Plum,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
a great bully, and Nat Poole, son of the money-lender
already mentioned. Plum had since reformed,
but Nat was as overbearing and dictatorial
as ever.</p>
<p>The great cloud resting over Dave in those days
was the question of his identity, and when some of
his enemies spoke of him as &#8220;that poorhouse nobody&#8221;
he resolved to find out who he really was.
Getting a strange clew, he set forth on his travels,
as described in &#8220;Dave Porter in the South Seas,&#8221;
where he found his uncle, Dunston Porter. Then
he came back to Oak Hall, as told of in &#8220;Dave
Porter&#8217;s Return to School,&#8221; and next went to the
Land of the Midnight Sun, as set forth in &#8220;Dave
Porter in the Far North,&#8221; where he was gladdened
by a long-hoped-for meeting with his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a poorhouse nobody now,&#8221;
he told himself, and went back to Oak Hall once
again, as set forth in &#8220;Dave Porter and His
Classmates.&#8221; Here he made more friends than
ever, but he likewise made enemies, the most bitter
of the latter being one Link Merwell, the son
of a ranch-owner of the West. Merwell did his
best to get Dave into trouble, but in the end was
exposed and had to leave the school.</p>
<p>Vacation time was now at hand, and through
Laura Porter, our hero&#8217;s newly-found sister,
Dave and his chums were invited to visit some of
Laura&#8217;s friends in the Far West. Laura Porter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
and Jessie Wadsworth went along; and what a
grand time the young folks had can be realized by
reading &#8220;Dave Porter at Star Ranch.&#8221; The
boys went hunting and fishing, and learned to do
some broncho-riding, and they likewise fell in
with Link Merwell again and showed that bully
up in his true colors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the grind now!&#8221; said Dave, after the
vacation was over, and back he did go, to Oak
Hall, as told of in &#8220;Dave Porter and His Rivals.&#8221;
That term was a lively one, for some lads came
there from another school, and they, led by Nat
Poole, tried to run matters to suit themselves.
But when the newcomers lost an important football
contest, Oak Hall woke up to the true condition
of affairs, and Dave and his chums quickly
regained their places on the eleven, and then won
a grand victory. During this time Link Merwell,
in company with another bad boy named Nick
Jasniff, became a student at Rockville Military
Academy, a rival institution of learning. Both
bullies did their best to make trouble for our
hero, but, as before, he exposed them, and this
time they had to flee to escape arrest.</p>
<p>When the Christmas holidays came around
Dave went back to Crumville, where he and his
family and old Caspar Potts now lived with the
Wadsworths. At that time Mr. Wadsworth had
at his jewelry works some rare diamonds, waiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
to be reset. Directly after Christmas came a
startling robbery. The diamonds were gone, and
it was learned by Dave that if they were not recovered,
not only would Mr. Wadsworth be
ruined, but that his own father and his uncle
would be seriously crippled financially, as they had
gone on a bond for the return of the gems.</p>
<p>At first, clews to the robbers were scarce, but
soon Dave made a queer discovery, and followed
this up by another, as set forth in the volume preceding
this, entitled, &#8220;Dave Porter on Cave
Island.&#8221; He and his chums became satisfied that
Link Merwell and Nick Jasniff had committed
the theft, and they followed the evil pair, first to
Florida and then to Cave Island, so named because
of the numerous caverns it contained. The
evil-doers were caught and the diamonds recovered,
but, at the last moment, Link Merwell managed
to escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;He acts as if he
wanted to turn over a new leaf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad it wasn&#8217;t Jasniff,&#8221; returned Phil.
&#8220;He is the worse of the pair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; agreed Roger.</p>
<p>The senator&#8217;s son and Phil had accompanied
Dave to Crumville, and all had received a warm
reception at the hands of those who were waiting
for them. Mr. Wadsworth was delighted to get
back the jewels, and thanked Dave over and over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
again for what he had done. Dave&#8217;s father and
his uncle were also happy, and as for Laura, she
had to hug her brother over and over again. Jessie
wanted to hug him, too, but her maidenly
modesty prevented this, but she gave Dave a look
and a hand squeeze that meant a good deal, for
our hero was her hero, too, and always had been.</p>
<p>The boys knew they had to go back to Oak
Hall, but the older folks had insisted that they
rest up a bit, after their traveling. So they
&#8220;rested&#8221; by going skating and sleigh-riding for
the last time that season, taking the girls along.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea,&#8221; said Dave&#8217;s uncle, one
morning, after the snow had cleared away. &#8220;The
roads are so fine just now, what is to prevent my
taking you to Oak Hall in the touring car? We
can make it in a day, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grand!&#8221; shouted Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the thing!&#8221; added Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t be better,&#8221; supplemented Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can ship your baggage on by express,&#8221;
went on Dunston Porter, &#8220;and then we&#8217;ll have
room enough to take Laura and Jessie, if they
want to go along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; burst out Roger, so quickly that it
made Phil wink, and then the senator&#8217;s son grew
red. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it all right?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; responded the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>The matter was talked over; and that night it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
was arranged that the two girls should go along
on the trip, returning later to Crumville with Mr.
Porter. Not to tire Laura and Jessie too much,
it was decided to leave after lunch the next day,
stopping over night at Ryeport, and finishing the
trip to Oak Hall the morning following.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only the good weather holds out,&#8221; said
Roger, wistfully. And then he added suddenly:
&#8220;Who is going to sit in front with your uncle,
Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are, of course,&#8221; broke in Phil, with
a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; stammered the senator&#8217;s
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Phil, you know you said you&#8217;d like that
seat,&#8221; broke in Dave. &#8220;He&#8217;s only fooling you,
Roger.&#8221; And then Roger looked quite satisfied,
for, it might as well be confessed, Roger and
Laura were very friendly and liked greatly to be
in each other&#8217;s company. The senator&#8217;s son had
a manly regard for Dave&#8217;s sister&mdash;the same kind
of a feeling that our hero had for dear little
Jessie.</p>
<p>The trunks and suit-cases had been shipped off,
and the big six-cylinder car&mdash;a new machine belonging
to the Porters&mdash;had been brought around,
with Dunston Porter at the wheel, for the old
hunter and traveler had taken a strong liking to
autoing. The girls and boys had piled in, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
much handshaking and some kisses, and now the
car was rolling out of the grounds, leaving Mr.
and Mrs. Wadsworth, Dave&#8217;s father, and old
Caspar Potts standing on the piazza, waving the
travelers adieu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care of yourself, my boy!&#8221; shouted Mr.
Porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, Dad!&#8221; called back Dave. &#8220;You take
it easy till I get back,&#8221; he added, for he knew that
his parent had been working hard of late.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to see Dave go&mdash;he is so full of life and
good cheer,&#8221; murmured Mrs. Wadsworth, with a
sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Best lad in the world,&#8221; added her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! The very best!&#8221; came in a quavering
voice from old Caspar Potts, and the tears
stood in his glistening eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust he comes through this year at Oak
Hall all right,&#8221; resumed Mr. Porter, as, the automobile
having disappeared, those left behind reentered
the house. &#8220;He wishes to graduate, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think he&#8217;ll come through?&#8221; asked
the manufacturer, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure about it. He has lost so much
time&mdash;on that trip he and the others took&mdash;you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Davy will come through, never fear!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
cried Caspar Potts. &#8220;I know the lad. If he
makes up his mind&mdash;well, it&#8217;s as good as done,&#8221;
and he nodded his whitened head several times.
To the old college professor who knew him so
well, there was no youth quite so clever and manly
as Dave Porter.</p>
<p>In the meantime the big touring car was leaving
Crumville rapidly behind. On the front seat, beside
Mr. Porter, sat Phil, waving an Oak Hall
banner and cracking all kinds of jokes. In the
back were the two girls with Dave and Roger.
All were well bundled up, for the air, though clear,
was still cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is where we make fifty miles an hour!&#8221;
cried the shipowner&#8217;s son, gayly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Phil!&#8221; burst out Laura. &#8220;Fifty miles
an hour! Uncle Dunston, don&#8217;t you dare&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil is fooling,&#8221; interrupted her uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it&mdash;I made a mistake&mdash;we are to go at
sixty miles an hour, just as soon as we pass the
next chicken coop. We won&#8217;t dare do it before,
for fear of blowing the coop over. We&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not make it seventy-five miles while you
are at it,&#8221; broke in Dave. &#8220;Nothing like going
the limit.&#8221; And at this there was a general laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a bad turn ahead,&#8221; said Dunston
Porter, a minute later. &#8220;They have torn up part
of the road around the hill. We&#8217;ll have to take it
pretty slowly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>The touring car crept up the hill, past several
heaps of dirt, and then started to come down on
the other side. Here there was a sharp curve,
with heavy bushes on both sides. Mr. Porter
blew the horn loud and long, to warn anybody
ahead that he was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; yelled Phil, suddenly. But the
warning was not necessary, for Dunston Porter
saw the danger and so did the others. A horse
and buggy were just ahead on the torn-up highway,
going in the same direction as themselves. The
horse was prancing and rearing and the driver
was sawing at the lines in an effort to quiet the
steed. It looked as if there might be a collision.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A TALK OF THE FUTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>The girls screamed and the boys uttered various
cries and words of advice. Dave leaned forward,
to jam on the hand-brake, but his uncle
was ahead of him in the action. The foot-brake
was already down, and from the rear wheels came
a shrill squeaking, as the bands gripped the hubs.
But the hill was a steep one and the big touring
car, well laden, continued to move downward,
although but slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep over! Keep over to the right!&#8221; yelled
Dunston Porter, to the driver of the buggy. But
the man was fully as excited as his horse, and he
continued to saw on the reins, until the turnout
occupied the very center of the narrow and
torn-up highway.</p>
<p>It was a time of peril, and a man less used to
critical moments than Dunston Porter might have
lost his head completely. But this old traveler
and hunter, who had faced grizzly bears in the
West and lions in Africa, managed to keep cool.
He saw a chance to pass on the right of the turnout
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
ahead, and like a flash he let go on the two
brakes and turned on a little power. Forward
bounded the big car, the right wheels on the very
edge of a water-gully. The left mud-guards
scraped the buggy, and the man driving it uttered
a yell of fright. Then the touring car went on, to
come to a halt at the bottom of the hill, a short
distance away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed Dave, as he looked back
at the turnout that had caused the trouble. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Mr. Poole!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Nat&#8217;s father?&#8221; queried Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, you! What do you mean by running into
me?&#8221; stormed the money-lender, savagely, as
he presently managed to get his steed under control
and came down beside the touring car.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by blocking the road, Mr.
Poole?&#8221; returned Dunston Porter, coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t block the road!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly did. If we had run into you,
it would have been your fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You passed me on the wrong
side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you didn&#8217;t give me room to pass on
the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your horn scared my horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how that is my fault. Your horse
ought to be used to auto-horns by this time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve scraped all the paint off my carriage,
and I had it painted only last week,&#8221; went on
the money-lender, warming up. &#8220;It&#8217;s an outrage
how you auto fellows think you own the whole
road!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t discuss the matter now, Mr. Poole,&#8221;
answered Dunston Porter, stiffly. &#8220;I think it was
your fault entirely. But if you think otherwise,
come and see me when I get back from this trip,
which will be in four days.&#8221; And without waiting
for more words, Dave&#8217;s uncle started up the
touring car, and Aaron Poole was soon left far
behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he isn&#8217;t a peach!&#8221; murmured Roger, slangily.
&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to see where Nat gets his meanness
from. He is simply a chip off the old block.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a pretty big chip,&#8221; returned Phil, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how he can blame us,&#8221; said Dave.
&#8220;We simply couldn&#8217;t pass him on the left. If we
had tried, we&#8217;d have gone in the ditch sure. And
the scraping we did to his buggy amounts to next
to nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of what he&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Dunston
Porter. &#8220;A couple of dollars will fix up
those scratches, and if he is so close-fisted I&#8217;ll foot
the bill. But I&#8217;ll give him a piece of my mind for
blocking the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But his horse was frightened, Uncle Dunston,&#8221;
said Laura.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A little, yes, but if Poole hadn&#8217;t got scared
himself he might have drawn closer to the side of
the road. I think he was more frightened than
the horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly was,&#8221; declared Phil. &#8220;When
we scraped the buggy his face got as white as
chalk, and he almost dropped the lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll hate all of us worse than ever for this,&#8221;
was Dave&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of him,&#8221; answered the uncle.</p>
<p>On and on sped the big touring car, and soon
the stirring incident on the road was, for the time
being, forgotten. Crumville had been left far behind,
and now they passed through one pretty
village after another. On the broad, level
stretches Dunston Porter allowed the boys to
&#8220;spell&#8221; him at the wheel, for each knew how to
run an automobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty miles more to Ryeport!&#8221; cried Dave,
as they came to a crossroads and read a signboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s just half-past five,&#8221; added the senator&#8217;s
son, consulting his watch. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get there
in plenty of time to wash up and have a fine
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, say, maybe we won&#8217;t do a thing to that
table!&#8221; murmured Phil, smacking his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you boys are always hungry,&#8221; was Jessie&#8217;s
comment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, we&#8217;ve got to grow,&#8221; answered
Phil, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll enjoy eating after such a long
ride,&#8221; said Laura. &#8220;The fresh air certainly does
give one an appetite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll order bread and milk for all
hands,&#8221; remarked Dunston Porter, with a sly
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bread and milk!&#8221; murmured Jessie, in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. It&#8217;s famous for your complexion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A juicy steak for mine!&#8221; cried Dave.
&#8220;Steak, and vegetables, and salad, and pudding or
pie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess that will do for me, too,&#8221; said
his uncle, simply. &#8220;You see, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to
eat to keep you company,&#8221; and he smiled again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Dunston, what a tease you are!&#8221; murmured
Laura. &#8220;Your appetite is just as good as
that of any of the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave was at the wheel, and he sent the touring
car along the smooth highway at a speed of
twenty miles an hour. He would have liked to
drive faster, but his uncle would not permit this.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law says twenty miles an hour, and I believe
in obeying the law,&#8221; said Dunston Porter.
&#8220;Besides, you can never tell what may happen,
and it is best to have your car under control.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth of the latter remark was demonstrated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
less than five minutes later, when they
came to another crossroads. Without warning of
any kind, a racing car came rushing swiftly from
one direction and a coach from the other. Dave
could not cross ahead of the racing car, and the
approach of the coach from the opposite direction
cut him off from turning with the car. So
all that was left to do was to jam on both brakes,
which he did, and then, as the racing car shot past,
he released the wheels and went on, just ahead
of the coach. But it was a narrow escape all
around, and the girls and Roger leaped to their
feet in alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phew! see them streak along!&#8221; was Phil&#8217;s
comment, gazing after the racing car, which was
fast disappearing in a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ought to be arrested!&#8221; was Laura&#8217;s
comment. &#8220;Why, we might have been smashed
up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work, Davy!&#8221; cried Dunston Porter.
&#8220;You did just the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if that coach driver is shaking his fist
at us, eh?&#8221; answered Dave, and he bobbed his
head in the direction of the coach, which had
hauled up but was now going on.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had been going a little faster it would
have been all up with us,&#8221; said Phil, with a grave
shake of his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take the wheel now,&#8221; said Dunston
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
Porter, quietly, and Dave slid out of the driving-seat
willingly enough, for the excitement had left
him somewhat limp.</p>
<p>Half-past six found them in Ryeport, and a
few minutes later they rolled up to the National
Hotel, and the girls and boys got out, while Mr.
Porter took the car around to the garage. They
had sent word ahead for rooms, and all soon felt
at home. The girls had a fine apartment on the
second floor, front, with Dunston Porter next to
them, and the three boys in a big room across the
hallway.</p>
<p>When the young people assembled in the dining-room,
after brushing and washing up, a surprise
awaited them. They had a table to themselves,
ordered by Dunston Porter, and decorated with a
big bouquet of roses and carnations. A full course
dinner was served.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this is lovely!&#8221; cried Jessie, as she caught
sight of the flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just grand, Uncle Dunston!&#8221; added Laura.
And then she added, in a lower voice: &#8220;If there
wasn&#8217;t such a crowd, I&#8217;d give you a big hug for
this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so would I,&#8221; added Jessie.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, that&#8217;s one you owe me, girls, remember
that,&#8221; answered the old hunter and
traveler.</p>
<p>They spent over an hour at the table, enjoying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
the bountiful spread provided, and telling stories
and jokes. The boys were in their element, and
kept the girls laughing almost constantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be back to the grind day after to-morrow,
so we had better make the best of it,&#8221;
was the way Dave expressed himself.</p>
<p>After the meal, Dunston Porter went out to
give directions concerning the touring car, and
Phil accompanied him. This left our hero and
Roger alone with the two girls. They sought out
the hotel parlor, which they found deserted, and
Dave and Jessie walked to the far end, where
there was an alcove, while Roger and Laura went
to the piano.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, won&#8217;t it be hard work to go back to the
grind, as you call it?&#8221; questioned Jessie, as both
stood looking out of the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, yes, but it&#8217;s what a fellow has got
to expect, Jessie,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;A chap can&#8217;t
get an education without working for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you pass with high honors,&#8221; the girl
went on, with a hopeful look into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try my best. Of course, I&#8217;ve lost some
time&mdash;going to Cave Island and all that. Maybe
I&#8217;ll flunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dave, that would be&mdash;be&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; Jessie
could not go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I get back I&#8217;m going to buckle
down, and get to be a regular greasy grind, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
they call &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve made up my mind to one
thing I&#8217;m afraid the others won&#8217;t like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to cut the baseball nine, if I can.
It takes too much time from our studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t that be easy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I made quite a record, you
know. Maybe the crowd will insist on it that I
play. Of course, I don&#8217;t want to see Oak Hall
lose any games. But I guess they&#8217;ll have players
enough&mdash;with all the new students coming
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you do graduate, Dave, what then?&#8221;
asked Jessie, after a pause. This question had
been on her mind a long time, but she had hesitated
about asking it.</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell the honest truth, Jessie, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
answered Dave, very slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought and
thought, but I can&#8217;t seem to hit the right thing.
Your father and Professor Potts seem to think
I ought to go to college, and I rather incline that
way myself. But then I think of going to some
technical institution, and of taking up civil engineering,
or mining, or something like that. Uncle
Dunston knew a young fellow who became a civil
engineer and went to South America and laid out
a railroad across the Andes Mountains, and he
knew another young fellow who took up mining
and made a big thing of a mine in Montana. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
sort of thing appeals to me, and it appeals to
Dad, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it would take you so far from home,
Dave!&#8221; and Jessie caught hold of his arm as she
spoke, as if afraid he was going to leave that
minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, but&mdash;er&mdash;but&mdash;would you care,
Jessie?&#8221; he stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Care? Of course, I&#8217;d care!&#8221; she replied, and
suddenly began to blush. &#8220;We&#8217;d all care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But would you care very much?&#8221; he insisted,
lowering his voice. &#8220;Because, if you would, I&#8217;d
tell you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you tell me?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young fellow who went to South America
as a civil engineer took his wife with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dave!&#8221; and for the moment Jessie
turned her head away.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I went so far off, I&#8217;d want somebody with
me, Jessie. A fellow would be awfully lonely
otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I suppose that would be so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you thought enough of a fellow, would you
go to South America, or Montana, or Africa with
him?&#8221; And Dave looked Jessie full in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d go to the end of the world with him,&#8221; she
answered, with sudden boldness.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Porter and Phil came back, and the
conversation became general.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>MR. JOB HASKERS&#8217;S DOINGS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;And now for Oak Hall!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Dave who uttered the words, the next
morning, after a good night&#8217;s rest and an early
breakfast. The big touring car had been brought
around by Dunston Porter, and the young folks
had climbed in and stowed away the limited baggage
they carried. All felt in excellent spirits,
and Dave was particularly gay. What Jessie had
said the evening before, and the way she had said
it, still hung in his mind. She was a splendid girl,
and if it was in him to do it, he was going to make
himself worthy of her. He was still young, so
he did not dwell long over these things, but his
regard for her was entirely proper, and likely to
make him do his best in his endeavors.</p>
<p>Phil had asked for permission to run the car
for a while and took the wheel as soon as Ryeport
was left behind. The shipowner&#8217;s son knew
how to handle an automobile almost as well as
any of them, but he had one fault, which was, that
he did not steer out of the way of sharp stones
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
and like things calculated to bring on punctures
and blow-outs.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, what a glorious morning!&#8221; exclaimed
Laura, as they bowled along over the smooth
roads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t be better,&#8221; answered Roger.
&#8220;Wish we were going on all day!&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; added Dave. They expected to
reach Oakdale by noon, get dinner there, and
then run up to the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not too fast, Phil,&#8221; warned Mr. Porter, as
the shipowner&#8217;s son &#8220;let her out a bit,&#8221; as he expressed
it. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what sort of a
road you&#8217;ve got beyond the turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon be coming to some roads we
know,&#8221; answered Phil. &#8220;Those we used to travel
on our bicycles.&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed through several towns and villages.
Then they reached a crossroads, and here
some men and a steam roller were at work, and
the road was closed. One of the workmen motioned
for them to take the road on the left.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be a road around,&#8221; said Dunston Porter.
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look very good, but you can try
it. Shall I take the wheel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can run the car easily enough,&#8221; answered
Phil.</p>
<p>For half a mile they went on without trouble,
through a rolling country where the scenery was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
very fine. Then they reached a point where the
road was full of loose stones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful!&#8221; cried Mr. Porter.</p>
<p>They rolled on, past a pretty farmhouse and
some barns. They were just on the point of making
another turn when there came a sudden bang!
from under the car, and the turnout swayed to one
side of the road. Phil threw out the clutch and
put on the brakes, and they came to a standstill.
Then the driver shut off the engine.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; queried Jessie.</p>
<p>&#8220;A blow-out, I guess,&#8221; answered Dave.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunston Porter and the boys got down to the
ground and made an examination. The shoe of
the rear left wheel had been badly cut by the
sharp stones and the inner tube had been blown out
through the cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to put on one of the other shoes,&#8221;
said Mr. Porter. They carried two with them,
besides half a dozen inner tubes.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, here is where we get to work!&#8221;
cried Dave. &#8220;Somebody time us, please,&#8221; and he
started in by getting off his coat and cuffs and donning
a working jumper. His uncle quickly followed
suit, while Phil and Roger got out
the lifting-jack and some tools.</p>
<p>The girls stood watching the proceedings for
a while and then strolled back towards the farmhouse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
The boys and Mr. Porter became so engrossed
in putting on a new inner tube and a shoe
that they did not notice their absence. The new
shoe fitted the rim of the wheel rather tightly
and they had all they could do to get it into
place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phew! this is work and no mistake!&#8221; murmured
Roger. &#8220;I wonder why they can&#8217;t get
tires that won&#8217;t blow out or go down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe some day they will have them,&#8221; answered
Dunston Porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon this is all my fault,&#8221; put in Phil,
ruefully. &#8220;I must have gone over some extra
sharp stone, and it cut like a knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, such accidents are liable to happen to
anybody,&#8221; answered Dave. He looked at his
watch. &#8220;Twenty-five minutes, and we haven&#8217;t
blown it up yet! No record job this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank fortune we&#8217;ve got a patent pump to do
the pumping for us,&#8221; remarked his uncle. Pumping
tires by hand he found a very disagreeable
task.</p>
<p>At last the shoe and tube were in place and
the pump was set in motion. Dave watched the
gauge, and when it was high enough he shut
off the air. The tools were put away, and they
were ready to go on again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls went back to that farmhouse,&#8221; said
the senator&#8217;s son, pointing to a small cottage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let us run back and pick them up, and wash our
hands at the well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once in front of the house, Dunston Porter,
who was at the wheel, sounded the horn. At the
same time the boys made for the well, which
stood between the house and one of the barns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the girls went inside,&#8221; remarked Dave,
as he looked in vain for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be somewhere around,&#8221; returned Phil.</p>
<p>All washed up, using soap and towels carried
in the car. Then Dave went to the door of the
farmhouse and knocked. In answer to the summons
Laura appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dave, come in!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I want
you to meet the lady here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wondering what his sister wanted, our hero
stepped into the sitting-room, which was small and
plainly but neatly furnished. In a rocking-chair
sat an elderly woman, pale and careworn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Breen, this is my brother,&#8221; said Laura.
&#8220;And these are his school chums,&#8221; she added,
nodding towards Phil and Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, boys?&#8221; said the woman, in a
thin, trembling voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just told her we were bound for Oak
Hall,&#8221; said Jessie, who was also present. &#8220;And
she says she knows somebody there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows Mr. Job Haskers,&#8221; finished Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers!&#8221; repeated Dave, mentioning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
the name of one of the teachers&mdash;a dictatorial individual
nobody liked, and who was allowed to
keep his position mainly because of his abilities as
an instructor. The chums had had more than one
dispute with Job Haskers, and all wished that he
would leave the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I know him,&#8221; answered Mrs. Breen,
nodding her head gravely and thoughtfully. &#8220;He
is a great scholar&mdash;a very great scholar,&#8221; and she
nodded again. She was not well and her mind
did not appear to be overly bright. She lived
alone in the cottage, a neighboring farmer taking
care of her few acres of ground for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, come here,&#8221; whispered Laura, and led
her brother to a corner of the room. &#8220;Mrs.
Breen tells me that Mr. Haskers owes her money&mdash;that
he used to board with her and that he borrowed
some&mdash;and she says he writes that he can&#8217;t
pay her because he gets so little salary, and
that sometimes he has to wait a long while himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much is it?&#8221; asked Dave, with interest.
He remembered how close-fisted Job Haskers
had been on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly two hundred dollars, so she says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to be able to pay that, Laura. I
think he gets a fair salary&mdash;in fact, I am sure of
it&mdash;and I am also pretty sure that Doctor Clay
doesn&#8217;t keep him waiting for his money.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad! She looks so helpless and so
much in need,&#8221; murmured the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find out about this,&#8221; answered Dave.</p>
<p>He sat down, as did the others, and soon had
the elderly lady telling her story in detail. It was
not very long. Job Haskers had boarded with
her one summer, just before obtaining his position
at Oak Hall, and he owed her sixty dollars
for this. During the time he had spent with her
he had spoken of a school-book he was going to
publish that would bring him in much money, and
she had loaned him a hundred and twenty-five
dollars for this. But she had never seen the
school-book, nor had he ever paid back a cent.
His plea, when she had written to him, had been
that his pay was poor and that he had to wait
a long time to get money, and that his publishers
had not yet gotten around to selling his
book.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of any book he got out,&#8221; said
Roger. &#8220;And I think I would hear if there was
such a book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; added Phil. &#8220;Old Haskers
would be so proud of it he would want everybody
to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly a shame he doesn&#8217;t pay this lady,
if he has the money,&#8221; was Dunston Porter&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;Did he give you a note?&#8221; he asked of
Mrs. Breen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He wrote out some kind of a paper and was
going to give it to me. But I never got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a swindler, that&#8217;s what he is!&#8221; murmured
Phil, wrathfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks that way,&#8221; answered Dave, in an
equally low tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows this lady is next to helpless and he
intends to do her out of the money!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to be sued,&#8221; exclaimed Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no note, or other writing about
the money?&#8221; questioned Mr. Porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have his letters,&#8221; answered the elderly lady.
&#8220;They are in the bureau yonder.&#8221; And she
pointed to an ancient chest of drawers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I get them?&#8221; asked Jessie, for she saw
that it was a task for the old lady to move around.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will, my dear. I am so stiff it is hard
to get up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both girls went to the chest of drawers and
brought out a small box of letters. Mrs. Breen
put on her glasses and fumbled them over and
brought forth three communications which were,
as the boys recognized, in Job Haskers&#8217;s well-known
jerky handwriting. She passed them over
to be read, and all present perused them with
interest.</p>
<p>The contents, however, were disappointing,
especially to the boys and Dunston Porter, who
had hoped to find something by which legally to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
hold the school-teacher. Not once did Job Haskers
mention that he owed Mrs. Breen any money.
He simply stated that he regretted he could do
nothing for her, that times were hard, and that
his income was limited and hard to get. He said
as little as possible, and the tone of the communications
showed that he hoped he would hear no
more from the old lady who had done what she
could to aid him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is the limit!&#8221; said Dave to his
uncle. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think he ought to be sued?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about suing him, Dave; but I
think this ought to be put in a lawyer&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He makes money enough to pay this lady,&#8221;
said Phil. &#8220;Say, I&#8217;ve a good mind to give him
a piece of my mind!&#8221; he added, hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look into this when I come back this way,&#8221;
said Dunston Porter, after a little more talk.
&#8220;Perhaps I can get one of our lawyers to prod
this Haskers a little, and also state the case to
Doctor Clay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, will you do that, Uncle Dunston?&#8221; cried
Laura, brightening, for she, as well as all of the
others, felt sorry for Mrs. Breen, who seemed so
poor, old, and lonesome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll do it. And now we had better be
on our way,&mdash;if we want to reach Oakdale by
noon,&#8221; went on Mr. Porter.</p>
<p>The boys went out, followed by Jessie. Laura
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
lingered, to whisper something in her uncle&#8217;s ear.
Dunston Porter nodded, and then Laura joined
the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Breen, I will be back in a day or two,
to see you about this money affair,&#8221; said Mr.
Porter, when he and the old lady were alone.
&#8220;In the meantime, as you were so kind as to take
the young ladies in while we were mending our
machine, allow me to make you a little present,&#8221;
and as he finished he placed a five-dollar bill in
her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, taking up the banknote.
&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s five dollars! I&mdash;I can&#8217;t really take all
that money!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you can,&#8221; said Mr. Porter, smiling.
&#8220;Use it as you see fit, and remember that I&#8217;ll be
back, and we&#8217;ll do what we can to get that money
from Mr. Haskers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very, very kind!&#8221; murmured the old
lady, and tears stood in her eyes. The past winter
had been a severe one for her, and she had had a
hard struggle to get along.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by!&#8221; shouted the girls and boys to her,
and she waved her hand to them. Then the
automobile started off once more, in the direction
of Oakdale.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>AT OAK HALL ONCE MORE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! here we are at Oakdale at
last!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old town looks natural, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it does, Roger. See any of the fellows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, Dave. But we are sure to meet
somebody, even if it is a school-day,&#8221; went on the
senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Dunston, let me take the auto around
to the hotel,&#8221; said our hero. &#8220;I know the streets
better than you do. We have to make several
turns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Dave,&#8221; was the ready answer, and
Dunston Porter arose and allowed his nephew
to crowd into the driver&#8217;s seat.</p>
<p>The run to the town in the vicinity of which
Oak Hall was located had been made without
further incident. On the way the party had talked
over Mrs. Breen&#8217;s affairs, and Dunston Porter
had promised to take the matter up, through his
lawyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it best that our names don&#8217;t appear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
in the case,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Otherwise, Mr. Haskers
might not treat you so well during the term.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never treats us well, anyway,&#8221; grumbled
Phil. &#8220;But you are right, don&#8217;t mention our
names.&#8221;</p>
<p>On this late winter day the town looked rather
dreary, but the young folks were in high spirits,
and Dave, with a grand flourish, ran the car up
to one of the best hotels the place afforded. As
before, word had been sent ahead that they were
coming, and the host of the resort came out to
meet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have dinner ready inside of quarter of
an hour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come in and make yourselves
at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The repast was fully as good as the dinner
served at Ryeport, and everybody enjoyed it
greatly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now for the Hall!&#8221; cried Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to leave us?&#8221; asked Jessie, half-reproachfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know better than to ask such a question,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;But if we have got to get
back to the grind, why, we might as well do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m a bit anxious to see how the old
place looks,&#8221; added the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, you can run the car to the Hall, if
you wish,&#8221; said Mr. Porter, feeling sure the youth
would like to do that very thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The touring automobile was brought around,
and they were just getting in when there came a
sudden hail from across the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there, everybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Dave Porter, and Roger, and Phil!&#8221;
said somebody else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how are you, Shadow!&#8221; cried our hero.
&#8220;And how are you, Buster?&#8221; he added, as
Maurice Hamilton and Buster Beggs came across
the road to greet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; puffed Buster, who was very fat and
jolly. &#8220;Only Shadow has been walking the feet
off of me!&#8221; And then the stout youth shook
hands all around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, just to hear that!&#8221; cried Shadow, as he,
too, shook hands. &#8220;Why, all we did was to walk
from the Hall to here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And up one street and down another for half
an hour,&#8221; burst in Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that puts me in mind of a story!&#8221; cried
Shadow, who was noted for his yarn-spinning
weakness. &#8220;Once two men started to walk&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stow it!&#8221; came from three of the other lads
in concert.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too early yet to tell stories, Shadow,&#8221;
said Dave, with a smile. &#8220;You can tell them to-night.
Tell us now, is there anything new at the
Hall?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There sure is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Phil and Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wild man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, has he turned up again?&#8221; asked the girls,
with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice&mdash;yesterday morning and this morning,&#8221;
said Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t turn up at all, Buster,&#8221; interposed
Shadow. &#8220;When you start to tell a story, why
don&#8217;t you tell it straight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you tell it,&#8221; grumbled the fat boy.
&#8220;You have that sort of thing down to a science.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t very much to tell,&#8221; went on
Shadow Hamilton. &#8220;He left his mark, that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Left his mark?&#8221; queried Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it&mdash;wide, blue marks. He must have
about a ton of blue chalk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Shadow, you are talking in riddles,&#8221;
burst out the shipowner&#8217;s son. &#8220;Give it to us
in plain United States, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I can. Well, this wild man visited the
school yesterday morning and this morning, before
anybody was up. The first time he went into
the big classroom and took some books, and the
next time he visited the kitchen and pantry and
took some grub&mdash;I beg the ladies&#8217; pardon&mdash;I
should have said food&mdash;a ham, a chicken, and
some doughnuts.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the blue chalk&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221; queried Mr.
Porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was coming to that. In the classroom he
left his mark&mdash;a big circle, with a cross inside,
in blue chalk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how do you know that is the mark of
the wild man?&#8221; asked Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we found that out some time ago,&#8221; answered
Shadow. &#8220;He seems to have a mania for
blue chalk, and even puts it on his face sometimes,
and he chalks down that circle with the cross
wherever he goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if he does that, why can&#8217;t they trail
him down?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he is like a flea&mdash;when you try to
put your hands on him he isn&#8217;t there,&#8221; answered
Shadow. &#8220;And say, that puts me in mind of another
story. Once three boys were&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do, Shadow!&#8221; cried Roger.
&#8220;About the wild man is enough for the present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they any idea who he is?&#8221; asked Dunston
Porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the slightest,&#8221; answered Buster. &#8220;And
they don&#8217;t know where he keeps himself, although
it must be in the woods near the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dave, I hope he doesn&#8217;t harm anybody!&#8221;
cried Jessie, with a shiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you boys ready to go back to the Hall?&#8221;
asked Dunston Porter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; responded Buster, readily.</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; added the story-teller of the
school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll take you along, provided you
don&#8217;t mind being crowded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t mind, if the young ladies won&#8217;t,&#8221; returned
the fat youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come in by all means!&#8221; cried Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make room somehow,&#8221; added Jessie.</p>
<p>A minute later the big car started on the way
to Oak Hall, with Dave at the wheel and his
uncle beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks familiar, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; called out Roger,
as they spun along the turnpike.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly does!&#8221; answered Roger, and then
he added, &#8220;What do you say to the old school
song?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; came back the answer, and then the
senator&#8217;s son commenced a song they all knew well,
which was sung to the tune of &#8220;Auld Lang Syne.&#8221;
The girls knew the song, too, and readily joined
in.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>Loud and clear over the cool air sounded the
song, and it was sung several times. Then, just
as the car rolled into the grounds of the school,
the boys gave one of the Hall yells, and Dave
honked the horn of the automobile loud and
long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! It&#8217;s the Porter crowd!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to our city!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Cave Island, Dave! Did you
bring it with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard you caught Jasniff and Merwell,
Roger. Good for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Phil, you&#8217;re as sunburnt as if you&#8217;d been
to the seashore for a summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the talk ran on as half a dozen students
flocked up to the car. The afternoon session was
over, and despite the chilliness many lads were out
on the campus. Many knew the girls&mdash;having
met them at some athletic games and at a commencement&mdash;and
those that did not were glad of
a chance for an introduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am real glad to see you back, boys,&#8221; said
Doctor Hasmer Clay, the head of the institution,
as he appeared and shook hands. &#8220;Glad to see
you, Mr. Porter, and also the young ladies,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;So you came all the way by automobile,
eh? It must have been a delightful
trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; answered Dave&#8217;s uncle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>All went inside, and the visitors were permitted
to accompany Dave and his chums to their dormitory.
The boys&#8217; baggage had already arrived, so
it did not take the lads long to settle down.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now we&#8217;ll have to start back,&#8221; said Dunston
Porter, a little later. &#8220;Dave, take good
care of yourself, and make a good record.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, Uncle Dunston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t let that wild man get you,&#8221; added
Jessie, as she took his hand and allowed him to
hold her own, perhaps longer than was necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t forget to write,&#8221; put in his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll not forget that!&#8221; answered Dave,
with a smile, both to his sister and to the girl
whom he regarded so warmly.</p>
<p>It was a trying moment&mdash;this parting&mdash;but it
was soon over, and, with Dunston Porter at the
wheel, and the girls and boys waving their hands,
the touring car left the Oak Hall grounds, on its
return journey to Crumville.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here we are, as the pug dog said to the
looking-glass, when he walked behind it to look
for himself,&#8221; remarked Phil, dropping into a
chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it will take us a few days to get
settled down,&#8221; answered Dave, resting on the top
of a table. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel much like unpacking
yet, do you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, let us wait until to-night or to-morrow,&#8221;
returned Roger, dropping on one of the beds.
He was still thinking of how clear and deep
Laura&#8217;s eyes had appeared when she had said
good-by to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really hope you will not be homesick,&#8221; said
a girlish voice, and Bertram Vane, one of the
students, appeared from the next room and sat
down on a chair. &#8220;Homesickness is such an
awfully cruel thing, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No homesickness here, Polly,&#8221; answered
Dave. &#8220;I guess we are just tired out, that&#8217;s all.
We&#8217;ve done a lot of traveling since we left Oak
Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I understand. Wasn&#8217;t it dreadful that
Jasniff and Merwell should prove such villains!&#8221;
went on the girlish student. &#8220;Weren&#8217;t you really
afraid to&mdash;er&mdash;to touch them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; cried Phil. &#8220;I am only sorry
Merwell got away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you got the diamonds, I heard?&#8221; put in
Sam Day, who was another of the chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment came musical sounds from another
room near by&mdash;the sounds of somebody
strumming on a guitar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there&#8217;s Luke Watson!&#8221; cried Roger.
&#8220;Hi, come in with that guitar and give us a tune,
Luke!&#8221; he called out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I might cheer you up,&#8221; said Luke,
appearing. &#8220;How would you like me to play
&#8216;The Girl I Left Behind Me,&#8217; or something like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it &#8216;Oh, Those Eyes So Tender!&#8217;&#8221;
suggested Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or else that beautiful ditty called, &#8216;He
Loved, But Had to Leave Her,&#8217;&#8221; suggested
Shadow. &#8220;Say, that puts me in mind of a
story,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;This is true, too, though
you may not believe it. A young man went to
call on his best girl and took a bouquet of flowers
along. The bouquet was done up in several thicknesses
of tissue paper. Some of his friends
who were jokers got hold of that bouquet
and fixed it up for him. He gave it to the girl,
and when she took off the tissue paper what
do you suppose she found? A bunch of celery
and some soup greens! He was so fussed
up he didn&#8217;t know what to say, and he got out in
a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for the chaps who fixed up the
bouquet!&#8221; cried Phil. &#8220;But start up, Luke.
Something in which we can all join.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not too loud,&#8221; cautioned Roger. &#8220;Old
Haskers might not like&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hang old Haskers!&#8221; interrupted Phil.
&#8220;He can&#8217;t&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-sh!&#8221; came from Dave, suddenly, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
silence fell on the group of boys. All turned
towards the doorway leading to the hall. There,
on the threshold, stood the instructor just mentioned,
Mr. Job Haskers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>PHIL SHOWS HIS STUBBORNNESS</h3>
</div>
<p>Not one of the boys knew how to act or what
to say. All wondered if Job Haskers had heard
his name mentioned.</p>
<p>If the ill-natured instructor had heard, he made
no mention of it. He looked sharply about the
apartment and waved his hand to Luke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson, how many times have I told you that
you make too much noise with your musical instruments?&#8221;
he said, harshly. &#8220;You disturb the
students who wish to study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought this was the recreation hour, Mr.
Haskers,&#8221; answered the lad, who loved to play
the guitar and banjo.</p>
<p>&#8220;True, but I think we get altogether too much
of your music,&#8221; growled the instructor. He
turned to Dave, Roger, and Phil. &#8220;So you are
back at last. It is high time, if you wish to go on
with your regular classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We told Doctor Clay that we would make up
what we have missed, Mr. Haskers,&#8221; answered
Dave, in a gentle tone, for he knew how easy it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
was to start a quarrel with the man before him.
As Phil had once said, Job Haskers was always
walking around &#8220;with a chip on his shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how soon will you make up the lessons
in my class?&#8221; demanded the instructor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can do it inside of ten days or two
weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t suit me, Porter. You&#8217;ll have to
do better. I&#8217;ll give each of you just a week&mdash;one
week, understand? If you can&#8217;t make the lessons
up in that time I&#8217;ll have to drop you to the
next lower class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Haskers!&#8221; burst out Roger. He
knew what that meant only too well. They would
not have a chance to graduate that coming
June.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not argue the point, Morr. I&#8217;ll give you
a week, starting to-morrow. When you come to
the classroom I will show you just what you have
to make up.&#8221; Job Haskers looked around the
room. &#8220;Now, then, remember, I want less noise
here.&#8221; And so speaking, he turned on his heel and
walked away.</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence, as the boys
looked at each other and listened to the sounds
of Mr. Haskers&#8217;s retreating footsteps. Then
Phil made a face and punched one of the bed pillows,
savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, wouldn&#8217;t that make a saint turn in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
grave?&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he the real, kind,
generous soul!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to be ducked in the river!&#8221; was
Buster&#8217;s comment. &#8220;Why, how can anybody
make up the lessons you&#8217;ve missed in a week?
It&#8217;s absurd! Say, do you know what I&#8217;d do if
I were you? I&#8217;d complain to the doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I,&#8221; added Sam Day. &#8220;Two weeks
would be short enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not complain to the doctor,&#8221; returned
Phil. &#8220;But I know what I will do,&#8221; he added,
quickly, as though struck by a sudden idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; came from several.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what. But I&#8217;ll wager he&#8217;ll give
us more time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I know what you think of doing,&#8221; said
Dave. &#8220;But take my advice and don&#8217;t, Phil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! I&#8217;ll see about it, Dave. He isn&#8217;t
going to run such a thing as this up my back without
a kick,&#8221; grumbled the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, wait first and see if he doesn&#8217;t change
his mind, or if we can&#8217;t get through in the week,&#8221;
cautioned Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was Phil going to do?&#8221; questioned
Luke, strumming lowly over the strings of his
guitar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about it,&#8221; cried Dave, before
Roger could speak. He did not wish the
Mrs. Breen affair to become public property.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
&#8220;Tell us about the wild man, and all the other
things that have happened here since we went
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you tell us all about Cave Island and
those stolen jewels,&#8221; said Buster.</p>
<p>Thereafter the conversation became general,
Dave and his chums telling of their quest of the
Carwith diamonds, and the other students relating
the particulars of a feast they had had in
one of the dormitories, and of various efforts
made to catch the so-called wild man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he is what one would call a
wild man,&#8221; said Ben Basswood, Dave&#8217;s old chum
from home, who had just come in from some experiments
in the school laboratory. &#8220;He is simple-minded
and very shy. He gets excited once
in a while, like when he threw those mud-balls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you ought to know,&#8221; remarked Buster.
&#8220;Ben is the only fellow here who has talked to
the man,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;When was that, Ben?&#8221; questioned Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was when the man first appeared,&#8221; answered
the Crumville lad. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t find out
until yesterday that he was the wild man, and then
it was because of that blue chalk he uses. I met
him in the woods when I was out during that last
snow, looking for rabbits with my shotgun. I
came across him, sitting on a rock, looking at an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
old newspaper. He had some of the blue chalk
in his hand and had marked a circle with a cross
on the rock. He asked me where I was going,
and told me to look out and not shoot a star, and
then he asked me if I used chalk for powder, and
said he could supply a superior brand of chalk
cheap. I thought at first that he was merely joking,
but I didn&#8217;t like the look in his eyes, and then
I made up my mind he was not right in his head,
and I left him. When I came back that way, an
hour later, he was gone, and I have never seen
him since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was this, Ben?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up in the woods, where the brook branches off
by the two big rocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the spot!&#8221; cried Roger. &#8220;Say, maybe
he hangs out around there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we hunted around there yesterday, but
he wasn&#8217;t to be seen. I don&#8217;t believe he has any
settled place of abode, but just roams through the
woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow! Somebody ought to catch him
and place him in a sanitarium,&#8221; was Dave&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>Various matters were talked over until the
supper hour, and then the boys filed down to the
dining-hall. Here our hero met more of his
school chums, including Gus Plum, who had once
been his enemy but who was now quite friendly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
and little Chip Macklin, who in days gone by had
been Plum&#8217;s toady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very glad to see you back, Dave!&#8221; cried Gus.
&#8220;And, say, you&#8217;ve certainly made a hero of yourself,&#8221;
he added, warmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was great, what you and Roger and Phil
did,&#8221; added Chip, in deep admiration.</p>
<p>Everybody was glad to see Dave back, and
after supper it was all he could do to get away
from many of his friends. But he managed it at
last, and he, Roger, and Phil went upstairs, to
put away their things and get out their schoolbooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have got to study and that is all there
is to it,&#8221; said Dave, firmly. &#8220;Fun is one thing
and getting ready to graduate is another. We
have got to get down to the grind, boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; answered the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t forget what old Haskers said,&#8221;
grumbled Phil. &#8220;He&#8217;ll make us sweat, just you
wait and see!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,&#8217;&#8221;
quoted Dave. &#8220;I think we can get through if we
buckle down hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing Mr. Dale and the other teachers
pin us down as old Haskers did?&#8221; demanded
Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; declared our hero. &#8220;Take
my word for it, Mr. Dale will give us a month,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
if we want it. I know him. And the others
will do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe we can get through, if that&#8217;s the
case,&#8221; said the shipowner&#8217;s son, slowly. &#8220;Just
the same, I think old Haskers the meanest man
alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following morning, after a good night&#8217;s
rest, the boys went to their various classes. As
Dave had predicted, Mr. Dale, the head teacher,
treated them with all possible consideration,
for he loved boys and understood them thoroughly.
The other teachers were likewise very
lenient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Haskers is the one stumbling-block,&#8221;
said Roger. &#8220;Dave, maybe we had better see
Doctor Clay about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; cried Phil. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a club
we can use on Haskers. Why not use it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, go to him and tell him we know
about that Mrs. Breen affair, and that we will
expose him if he doesn&#8217;t let up on us, Phil?&#8221; said
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that is a&mdash;well, a gentlemanly
thing to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what old Haskers would do, if he was in
our place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. But I&#8217;d rather not do it. Let my
uncle&#8217;s lawyer try to collect that money without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
our appearing in the case. We have had trouble
enough in the past with Haskers. Let us buckle in
and study up. I am sure we can get through,&#8221;
added Dave, earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; growled Phil; but his manner
showed that he was not satisfied.</p>
<p>Two days went by, and the boys settled down to
the regular routine of the school. The lessons to
be made up were exceedingly hard, and Dave
found he had to study almost constantly to do
what was required of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am going to make it!&#8221; he murmured,
setting his teeth hard. &#8220;I am not going to disappoint
the folks at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>One afternoon the three chums had a very hard
lesson in Latin to do. It was a clear, sunshiny
day and they had one of the windows wide open
to let in the fresh air. Dave and Roger were
bending over their books when they heard a sudden
exclamation from Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be hanged if I&#8217;m going to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then of a sudden a Latin book was hurled
across the room, to land on a bureau, just missing
the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried Dave, raising his head.
&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to do it!&#8221; cried Phil, stretching
himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s an outrage and I won&#8217;t submit
to it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean this boning away for Haskers?&#8221;
queried Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that,&#8221; answered the shipowner&#8217;s son.
&#8220;Why can&#8217;t he treat us as fairly as the other
teachers did? It wouldn&#8217;t hurt him a bit to give
us more time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil, what&#8217;s the use of talking it over again?&#8221;
asked Dave. &#8220;I thought we had settled it once
for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t stand it, I tell you,&#8221; cried Phil,
stubbornly. &#8220;He can&#8217;t make a pack-mule of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, speak to the doctor about it,&#8221;
advised Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to speak to the doctor,&#8221; stormed
Phil; and walking over to a rack, he caught up his
cap and marched from the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is certainly in a bad humor,&#8221; was Dave&#8217;s
comment. &#8220;I am afraid he&#8217;ll put his foot into it,
Roger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I. He&#8217;s been aching to get back at old
Haskers ever since he put all this studying up to
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Ben is just as angry at Haskers
as Phil is?&#8221; went on our hero, after a pause, during
which both had hoped that their close chum
would return. But Phil had stalked down the
stairs and out of the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so he told me this noon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ben talked in class and old Haskers
penalized him heavily&mdash;gave him a lot of extra
Latin to do. It nearly broke Ben up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told Ben about that Breen affair, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he and Phil will both go to Haskers
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not, Roger. I don&#8217;t think it is just
the right thing to do&mdash;to use that as a club over
Haskers to get him to let us off. I don&#8217;t like
that kind of dealing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I. But it&#8217;s just what such a mean-spirited
fellow as Haskers deserves. He has
never treated us squarely since we came here. I
think this school would be a good deal better off
without him, even if he is well educated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave heaved a deep sigh. He was on the point
of replying, but changed his mind. He took up
his book again, and soon was trying his best to
study. Roger followed his example.</p>
<p>But both boys made slow progress. Each was
thinking about Phil. What would be the outcome
of their headstrong chum&#8217;s actions?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>PHIL AND BEN MAKE A MOVE</h3>
</div>
<p>So far Dave and Nat Poole had not met face
to face. Our hero had seen the money-lender&#8217;s
son a number of times, but Nat had always been
with some of his cronies and had, apparently, not
taken any notice.</p>
<p>But on the morning following the conversation
just recorded, the pair came face to face in one
of the narrow hallways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Nat,&#8221; said Dave, pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning,&#8221; grumbled the other student. He
was about to pass Dave, but suddenly changed his
mind. &#8220;So you got back, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been back several days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that Link Merwell got away from
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! If I had the chance to nab him
that you had, I&#8217;d not let him get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We held Jasniff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you let Merwell go on purpose,&#8221; continued
the money-lender&#8217;s son, shrewdly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Nat. He gave us the slip, clean
and clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; Nat paused for a moment. &#8220;I
got word from my dad that you almost smashed
him up on the road with your auto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly as bad as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is going to make your uncle pay for the
damage done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was enough. You want to be more careful
with your car after this. You auto fellows
seem to think you own the whole road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about your motor-boat, Nat?&#8221; asked
Dave. He remembered how the money-lender&#8217;s
son had played more than one mean trick while
running the craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my boat is all right, Dave Porter!&#8221;
sniffed Nat; and then he moved on, with a scowl
on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same old Nat,&#8221; soliloquized our hero.
&#8220;Too bad that he can&#8217;t make himself a bit more
agreeable.&#8221;</p>
<p>That day was a particularly trying one in the
classroom. The lessons were unusually hard,
and Dave had all he could do to pass, especially
in those studies presided over by Professor Haskers.
Roger made one miss in his Latin and
poor Phil made several, while Ben Basswood&#8217;s
recitation was a complete failure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>As was usual with him, Job Haskers was exceedingly
dictatorial, and said some cutting things that
brought the blood to Dave&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must do much better than this, Porter
and Morr,&#8221; said the professor. &#8220;Otherwise I
shall have to place you in the next lower class.
You, Lawrence and Basswood, have failed so utterly
that I will have to take your cases under
immediate consideration. The class is dismissed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old bear!&#8221; growled Ben, under his
breath.</p>
<p>He looked inquiringly at Phil, and the latter
nodded knowingly.</p>
<p>Dave did not know what to do. He did not
wish Phil and Ben to get into further trouble, yet
he did not know how to interfere. Besides, he
was suffering himself and hardly knew what to do
on his own account.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the worst yet,&#8221; cried Roger, as he and
our hero came out of the classroom side by side.</p>
<p>&#8220;There go Phil and Ben,&#8221; returned Dave.
&#8220;Roger, they have got some plan up their sleeve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you, Dave. I wish I knew what to
do. Shall we go to Doctor Clay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking of that, Roger. But I
hate to do it. I&#8217;d rather fight my own battles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us wait until to-morrow and see if things
don&#8217;t take a turn for the better.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right, just as you say. But it&#8217;s a shame,
the way old Haskers treats us,&#8221; grumbled the
senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>In the meantime Phil and Ben had gone on
ahead. Both were exceeding angry and consequently
not in a frame of mind to use their best
judgment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an outrage!&#8221; burst out the shipowner&#8217;s
son. &#8220;An outrage, Ben! I am not going to stand
for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am with you, Phil,&#8221; returned Ben.
&#8220;But what can we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I spoke about last evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about doing that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am with you, if you are game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we may make old Haskers tearing
mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll only face him with the truth, won&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, let us do it. And the sooner the
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but we must see him alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I think we can manage it just before
supper&mdash;when he goes up to his room to fix
up for the evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two chums talked the affair over for a
long time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose Dave will like this,&#8221; ventured
Ben, presently. &#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t hit as hard as we are,&#8221; answered
Phil, lamely. &#8220;If he was&mdash;well, he might look
at things in a different light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; answered Ben. But deep down
in his heart he was afraid that our hero would
not altogether approve of what he and Phil proposed
to do.</p>
<p>The boys took a walk, and purposely kept out
of the way of Dave and Roger. They did not
return to the Hall until fifteen minutes before the
first bell for supper. Then they came in by a side
entrance and passed swiftly up the stairs and
along the hallway to the room occupied by Job
Haskers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked the teacher, sharply, when
Phil had knocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers, it is Phil Lawrence,&#8221; was the
reply. &#8220;Ben Basswood is with me. We wish to
see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed!&#8221; said the teacher, coldly. &#8220;You
come to me at an unusual hour. You may see me
to-morrow, before class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers, we wish very much to see
you now,&#8221; put in Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have got to see you,&#8221; added Phil, warmly.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reply to this. The
boys heard Job Haskers moving around the room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
and heard him shut a bureau. Then the door was
flung open.</p>
<p>&#8220;You insist upon seeing me, eh?&#8221; demanded
the professor, harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do, Mr. Haskers,&#8221; returned Phil, boldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, young gentlemen; step in.&#8221; And
Job Haskers glared at the boys as he stood aside
for them to enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came to see you, sir, about those Latin
lessons,&#8221; went on Phil, finding it just then difficult
to speak. He realized that Job Haskers
was in no humor for being lenient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; shot out the professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel that we are not being treated fairly,&#8221;
put in Ben, believing he should not make Phil do
all the talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not treated fairly? I believe I am the best
judge of that, Basswood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers, I hate to say it, but you are a
hard-hearted man!&#8221; cried out Phil, the door being
closed, so that no outsider might hear. &#8220;You
are not giving us a fair chance. The other teachers
have given me and Dave Porter and Roger
Morr several weeks in which to make up those lessons
we missed while we were away. You wish
to give us only a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t give me a fair chance to make
up,&#8221; added Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, who is master here, you or I?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
demanded Job Haskers, drawing himself up.
&#8220;Boys, you are impudent! I will not stand it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you will stand it,&#8221; cried Phil, throwing
caution to the winds. &#8220;All we ask is a fair deal,
and you have got to give it to us. We&#8217;ll make up
those lessons, if you&#8217;ll give us a fair amount of
time. I don&#8217;t intend to be put in a lower class for
nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m not going to stand it either,&#8221; came
from Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! this to me?&#8221; snarled Job Haskers.
&#8220;Take care, or I&#8217;ll have you dismissed from the
Hall!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you try it, it will be the worst day&#8217;s work
you ever did, Mr. Haskers,&#8221; warned the shipowner&#8217;s
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, you threaten me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to make you give us a fair
chance, that is all. And if you&#8217;ll do that, we&#8217;ll give
you a fair chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, why&mdash;you&mdash;you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; The irate instructor
knew not for the moment how to proceed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers, I think you had better listen
to me,&#8221; pursued Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have listened to all I care to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you haven&#8217;t. There is much more&mdash;and
you had better listen closely&mdash;if you care at
all for your reputation here at Oak Hall.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>The professor stared at the boy and grew a
trifle pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&mdash;what do you&mdash;er&mdash;mean by that,
Lawrence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate very much to bring this subject up,
Mr. Haskers, but you practically compel me to
do it. If you will only promise to give us a fair
chance to make up our lessons, I won&#8217;t say a word
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean?&#8221; faltered the
teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know something about your doings in the
past&mdash;doings which are of no credit to you. If
you disgrace Ben and me by degrading us in
classes, we&#8217;ll disgrace you by telling all we know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you know?&#8221; demanded Job
Haskers, hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know a good deal,&#8221; put in Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;All about your dealing with the poor widow,
Mrs. Breen,&#8221; added the shipowner&#8217;s son. &#8220;How
you still owe her for board, and how you borrowed
money to publish a book that was never issued.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; cried Job Haskers,
stepping back in consternation. &#8220;Who told you
that I had borrowed money from her, and that I
owed her for board?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind who told us,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;We
know it is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you went to that lawyer, eh?&#8221; stormed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Professor Haskers. &#8220;You got him to threaten
a suit, didn&#8217;t you? I got his letter only this
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We went to no lawyer,&#8221; answered Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know better! I see it all now! You want
to get me into trouble&mdash;to disgrace me here!&#8221;
Job Haskers began to pace the floor. &#8220;It is&mdash;er&mdash;a
mistake. I meant to pay that lady but it&mdash;er&mdash;slipped
my mind. And the book has been
issued, but the publishers have not&mdash;er&mdash;seen fit
to push it, that is why you and the world at large
have not heard of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers, we haven&#8217;t told anybody about
this,&#8221; went on Phil, pointedly. &#8220;You can settle
with that lawyer, whoever he may be,&mdash;and we&#8217;ll
not say a word to anybody&mdash;that is, providing
you&#8217;ll give us a fair chance in our lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! maybe you wish me to pass you without
an examination,&#8221; cried the teacher, cunningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; answered Phil, stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We simply ask for more time, that is all,&#8221;
added Ben. &#8220;We don&#8217;t ask any favor. We can
make up the lessons if you will give us as much
time as the other teachers would give us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not told anybody of this&mdash;this&mdash;er&mdash;affair
of Mrs. Breen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all a mistake, but I should not like it to
get abroad. It would hurt my reputation a great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
deal. I shall settle the matter in the near future.
I do not owe that lady as much as the lawyer says
I do,&mdash;but that is not your affair.&#8221; Job Haskers
continued to pace the floor. &#8220;Now about your
lessons,&#8221; he continued, after a pause. &#8220;If I&mdash;er&mdash;thought
that I had really been too hard on
you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly have been hard,&#8221; said Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you really need more time&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us two weeks more and we&#8217;ll be all
right,&#8221; put in Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if&mdash;er&mdash;if I should decide to do that, you
will&mdash;er&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make good&mdash;and keep our mouths
shut,&#8221; finished Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I will think it over, young gentlemen,
and let you know to-morrow morning,
before class. And in the meantime&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t say a word to anybody,&#8221; said Ben,
with a little grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;So be it;&#8221; and Job Haskers bowed. &#8220;There
is the supper-bell. You may go now. Come to
me just before class to-morrow,&#8221; he added; and
then the two students passed out of the room, and
the teacher shut the door after them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AN UNUSUAL COMPACT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do it&mdash;he is bound to do it!&#8221; cried
Ben, as he and Phil hurried down to the dining-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so myself, Ben,&#8221; answered the shipowner&#8217;s
son. But, for some reason, he did not
seem as joyful over the outcome of the interview
as might have been expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t dare let this news become public
property,&#8221; went on the other student. &#8220;He is
too afraid of public opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben, he thinks we got that lawyer to take
the case up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told him we hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t believe it&mdash;I could tell that by
his manner. And, Ben, do you know, after all,
this looks to me as if we had, somehow, bribed
him to be easy on us,&#8221; continued Phil, with added
concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t bother your head about that, Phil.
We only asked for what is fair, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; And then the shipowner&#8217;s son
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
did not finish, because he did not know what to
say. In some manner, Phil&#8217;s conscience troubled
him, and he wondered what Dave and Roger
would say when they heard of what had occurred.</p>
<p>During the meal that followed but little was
said by any of the boys. Once or twice our hero
looked at Phil, but the latter avoided his gaze. As
soon as the repast was over, Phil rushed outside,
followed by Ben; and that was the last seen of
the pair until it was time to go to bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have been up to something, that is certain,&#8221;
was the comment of the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can only wait and see what turns
up,&#8221; answered Dave, thoughtfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think I care to ask them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning, when Dave got up he looked
over to where Phil was in the habit of sleeping.
The bed was empty, and the shipowner&#8217;s son was
gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dressed half an hour ago,&#8221; said another of
the dormitory inmates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Went off again with Ben, I&#8217;ll wager,&#8221; murmured
Roger. Ben was in another room, across
the hallway, that term.</p>
<p>Dave and Roger had been hard at work the
evening before, doing their best to make up the
lessons they had missed while away from the
school. They doubted if Phil and Ben had studied
at all. With considerable curiosity they awaited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
the opening of the morning classes, to see what
might happen. They felt that something was &#8220;in
the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just before the last bell rang Phil and Ben appeared,
their faces wreathed in smiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, fellows!&#8221; cried the shipowner&#8217;s
son, merrily. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we can take our time making up those
missed lessons,&#8221; added Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;You went to old Haskers?&#8221; queried Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sure did,&#8221; answered the shipowner&#8217;s
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;And told him about&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what we told him, Dave,&#8221; interrupted
Phil. &#8220;We did tell him that we wanted
to make up the lessons but couldn&#8217;t do it in the
time he had allotted. He argued it, at first, but
now he has agreed to give us the same time Mr.
Dale did, three weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, or all of us?&#8221; asked our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us. I think he&#8217;ll speak to you at
recess&mdash;he said he would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say when you&mdash;when you mentioned
Mrs. Breen?&#8221; asked Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, somebody might hear you!&#8221; returned
Phil, in a whisper. &#8220;We have promised to keep
that quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the poor woman&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will get her money, never fear. A lawyer
has already written about it, and old Haskers
says he will pay up. He claims it is all a mistake.
But he doesn&#8217;t want anybody at Oak Hall to
get wind of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no time to say more, and evidently
neither Phil nor Ben felt in the humor to discuss
the affair. The early morning lesson proceeded
as usual, but it was noticed that Professor Haskers
was much subdued in his manner towards
the students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Porter and Morr, I wish to speak to you at
recess,&#8221; said he, coming down to where the two
lads sat. &#8220;Kindly remain here.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the other students had left the classroom
the instructor came to our hero and his
chum and motioned for them to follow him to
a private room close by.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to speak to you about the lessons you
are to make up,&#8221; said Job Haskers, after clearing
his throat several times. &#8220;I understand that you
want more time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We would like to have more time, yes,&#8221; answered
Dave, briefly, and looking the teacher full
in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do the lessons in three weeks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Haskers,&#8221; said Dave, and Roger
nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can take that much time. But, remember,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
I shall expect you to&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;to make
up the lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; came from both students.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you need more time&mdash;or any assistance&mdash;possibly
I can arrange it,&#8221; went on Job Haskers,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, if you give me three weeks I am
sure I can make up the lessons to your satisfaction,
Mr. Haskers,&#8221; came from our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so can I,&#8221; added the senator&#8217;s son.
&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;ll try my level best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then, we will let it stand that way.&#8221;
There was a pause and the instructor bit his lip
several times. &#8220;By the way, I&mdash;er&mdash;understand
that there is a very unpleasant rumor going around
concerning me,&#8221; he proceeded. &#8220;It is all a mistake
which I shall try to clear up without delay.
I trust that you will not attempt to&mdash;er&mdash;to circulate
that rumor any further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers, do you mean about that affair
with Mrs. Breen?&#8221; demanded Dave, bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I have already explained to Lawrence
and Basswood that it is a mistake, and that the
widow will be paid all that is due her. But if
this should&mdash;er&mdash;be mentioned here&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; The
teacher stopped short and looked sharply at Dave
and Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers, let us understand each other,&#8221;
answered Dave, quickly. &#8220;I have no desire whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
to get you or anybody else into trouble. Nor
do I want to ask you for any favors. I think
we are justly entitled to more time in which to
make up those lessons, and now that you have
granted that time, I shall do my best to make good.
As for that Mrs. Breen affair, I think that poor
old lady ought to have her money. I understand
some lawyer is going to try to collect it for her.
Well, if you settle the matter I shall feel very
glad; and you can rest assured that I will not say
a word about the matter to anybody in this school,
or anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;er&mdash;you give me your word on that,
Porter?&#8221; demanded the instructor, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Morr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else is there who knows about this&mdash;er&mdash;unpleasant
affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil Lawrence and Ben Basswood,&#8221; answered
Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;No other students?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I know of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then.&#8221; Job Haskers drew a breath
of relief. &#8220;See that you keep your word. And
about the lessons&mdash;if three weeks are not long
enough, I may&mdash;er&mdash;be able to give you a little
more time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That time will be enough,&#8221; replied Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make it with ease,&#8221; added Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that is settled, and you may go,&#8221; and
so speaking, Job Haskers left the room. The two
boys followed him, and went out on the campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you make out?&#8221; questioned Phil, as
he ran up to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got our time,&#8221; answered Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;But let me tell you one thing,&#8221; said Dave.
&#8220;After this Haskers is going to hate us worse
than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why,&#8221; declared the shipowner&#8217;s
son. &#8220;I think we are letting him off mighty
easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He feels as if he had been forced into doing
what we want,&#8221; went on Dave. &#8220;I think he looks
at it as if you had used that Mrs. Breen incident
as a club over him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was a club in one sense, Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Phil, and, although I am glad we
have won out and gotten that extra time, still I am
sorry that you and Ben went to him as you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! did you think I was going to sit still
and be put back into a lower class?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it might have been better if you had
gone to Doctor Clay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; replied Phil, shortly; and
then the school-bell rang again and all the boys
had to go to their next classes.</p>
<p>In spite of the cloud that thus hung over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
affair, every one of the chums was glad of the
extra time in which to make up the lost lessons.
Not one of them had to grind away as hard as before,
and Dave took a little time off, in which
to send a letter to his father and another to
Jessie.</p>
<p>The next day was warm and pleasant and, after
school-hours, Roger proposed to Dave that they
take a walk up the woods road back of the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, a walk in the woods will do us
good,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Shall we ask some of
the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish,&#8221; and in the end Phil went along,
and also Buster Beggs and Gus Plum.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but I had a run-in with old Haskers
this afternoon,&#8221; said the stout youth. &#8220;I came
close to carrying the matter to the doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it about?&#8221; questioned Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing at all, to my way of thinking. I
went to the library to get a book and he accused
me of wasting my class time. He was very ugly.
I won&#8217;t stand for much more of it,&#8221; grumbled
Buster.</p>
<p>Dave said no more, but he and Roger exchanged
glances. Evidently the irate instructor
was going to &#8220;take it out of somebody,&#8221; as the
saying goes.</p>
<p>The boys walked on and on, along the road,
until Oak Hall was left far behind. Soon Buster
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
forgot his troubles, and the crowd were chatting
gayly of many things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call for candidates for the baseball team
next Saturday,&#8221; announced Gus Plum. &#8220;I hope
we get up a team this year that knocks the spots
out of Rockville Military Academy and all the
other institutions we cross bats with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to try for the nine this term,
Gus?&#8221; questioned Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Why not? You&#8217;ll try, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
went on the big youth, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve decided not to go into athletics this
term, Gus. I want to give all my time to my
studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but the nine needs you, Dave!&#8221; put in
Buster. &#8220;I heard some of the fellows talking
about it only yesterday. They had you slated
for your old position.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if Gus wants to play, he can fill the
box,&#8221; answered Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we need more than one pitcher,&#8221; insisted
Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are plenty of new students coming
along. I hear Thomas is a good one, and so is
Ennis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to play, either,&#8221; said Roger.
&#8220;I want to graduate with all the honors possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about you, Phil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think I&#8217;ll play,&#8221; answered the shipowner&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
son, rather lamely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see about it
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to neglect my studies,&#8221;
said Gus Plum. &#8220;But I have done some hard
work this winter and so I am pretty well ahead.
I didn&#8217;t lose time going to Cave Island, you
know,&#8221; he added, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was worth it&mdash;losing that time,&#8221; answered
Dave. &#8220;It saved Mr. Wadsworth from
ruin, and that&#8217;s a good deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the baseball nine&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; commenced Buster,
and then broke off short. &#8220;What was that?&#8221;
he demanded, as a cry from a distance broke on
the ears of all.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s voice!&#8221; cried Dave, quickly.
&#8220;She is calling for help! Come on and see what
is the matter!&#8221; And he started off on a run,
with his school chums at his heels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE KING OF SUMATRA</h3>
</div>
<p>The boys had been traveling along a broad
highway that ran to a town on the other side of
the woods. The trees were thick and so were the
bushes, with here and there a big rock, covered
with the dead vines of the summer previous.</p>
<p>At one point some distance ahead was an old
stone house, standing where another road ran in
the direction of the river. This house had not
been inhabited for years, and the doors and windows
were gone, and the falling of the chimney
had smashed in a large portion of the sloping
roof.</p>
<p>It was from in front of the old house that
the cries for assistance came, and now the boys
heard two voices, both somewhat girlish in
tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let me go! Please, let me go!&#8221; came,
wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no right to touch us!&#8221; was added,
in another voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; called out Dave, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
loudly as he could. But in his mind there had
already flashed an inkling of what was going on.
For some time past the wild man of that locality
had not shown himself. Now, perhaps, he was
again at his old tricks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, make him go away!&#8221; screamed a girlish
voice, and then, as our hero made a turn of
the road, he caught sight of two girls standing
near the old stone house. Back of them was another
figure, that of a tall, powerful man, but
this figure disappeared as if by magic, behind the
ancient building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Rockwell!&#8221; exclaimed Dave, as
he recognized a young lady from town whom he
knew well. &#8220;And you, too, Miss Feversham!
What is the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That man&mdash;the wild man!&#8221; panted Vera
Rockwell. &#8220;He&mdash;he&mdash;stopped us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted our purses!&#8221; added Mary Feversham,
the other young lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; asked Roger and Phil, in a
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;He just ran behind the house&mdash;I saw him,&#8221;
answered Dave. &#8220;Did he hurt you any?&#8221; he
went on, anxiously, for he and Vera and Mary
were good friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but he&mdash;he scared us so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go after him!&#8221; put in Phil, quickly.
He had taken Mary Feversham out a number of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
times and the two were well acquainted. &#8220;Come
on!&#8221; and he started around the house.</p>
<p>All of the others were not slow to follow. Behind
the building they came upon a mass of weeds
and bushes and in their midst the remains of an
old well, long since caved in. What had once
been a path led to the side road before mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way he must have gone&mdash;down the
side road!&#8221; cried the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing we see if we can catch him?&#8221;
suggested Dave. &#8220;But somebody ought to go
back, and stay with the girls,&#8221; he added thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back,&#8221; answered Phil. He was only
too glad of a chance to talk to Mary, not having
seen her for a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that fellow comes back, whistle for us,&#8221;
advised Roger.</p>
<p>Dave was already on the side road with Buster
and Gus beside him, and the senator&#8217;s son quickly
followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go too fast or I&mdash;I can&#8217;t ke&mdash;keep up
with you!&#8221; panted Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see anything of him, Dave?&#8221; queried
Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, but there is a turn just ahead. When
we make that we&#8217;ll be able to see almost to the
river.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>All of the students sped on, the stout lad doing
his best to keep up with the others. They
reached the turn with Dave a step or two in
advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see him! Say, he&#8217;s wild-looking enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is making for the river!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be able to catch him. We are
four to one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave and Roger pressed forward with increased
speed and poor Buster fell somewhat behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming as fa&mdash;fast as I ca&mdash;can!&#8221;
blurted out the fat youth. &#8220;Go on&mdash;I&#8217;ll get there
sooner or later!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick up a stick, if you see one,&#8221; cried Dave,
to Roger and Gus. &#8220;We may have a hot fight on
our hands. That man ought to be in jail, or in
an asylum.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they sped along, the three kept their eyes
open and each presently armed himself with a fair-sized
club. The wild man was running like a deer,
pausing occasionally to turn and brandish his long
arms at them savagely. They could see that his
clothing was in tatters and that his hair and beard
were long and unkempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! stop!&#8221; called out Dave, although he had
but little hope of causing the man to halt. &#8220;We
want to talk to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go back! Beware! Go back, or it will be
the worse for you!&#8221; called the wild man. &#8220;Leave
the King of Sumatra alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The King of Sumatra?&#8221; repeated Roger.
&#8220;Say, he&#8217;s crazy sure enough, to imagine himself
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys continued after the wild man and
urged him to stop. But instead of heeding them,
he ran on the faster.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an athlete, when it comes to running,&#8221;
remarked Dave, as he tried in vain to get closer
to the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say crazy people are always strong,&#8221;
answered the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve go&mdash;got to gi&mdash;give up!&#8221; panted Gus,
and came to a halt. &#8220;Go&mdash;got a pa&mdash;pain in my
side!&#8221; And he put his hand over his hip.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll manage alone!&#8221; cried Roger.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we can catch that fellow anyway,&#8221;
he added, half under his breath.</p>
<p>Another turn of the woodland road brought the
Leming River into plain view, at a point where
the stream was both wide and deep. The wild
man kept sprinting along and it was impossible
for the boys to draw any closer to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we threaten to shoot him if he won&#8217;t
stop?&#8221; asked Roger. Neither of the lads carried
firearms.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
<img src='images/illus-002.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 319px; height: 500px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 319px;'>
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried Dave.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 87.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;No, he might do some shooting on his own
account,&mdash;if he is armed. Come on, he may fall,
or something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside of three minutes more the wild man
gained the shore of the river and disappeared
around a point of rocks and brushwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful, Dave,&#8221; warned Roger. &#8220;He
may spring out at you with a club.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my eyes open,&#8221; was the ready reply.</p>
<p>Both advanced with caution, and soon came up
to the nearest of the rocks. With clubs ready for
use, the two youths continued to move forward.
Then they came to a sudden halt. The wild man
was no longer in sight. What had become of
him?</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he ran into the woods,&#8221; suggested
Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, but&mdash;hark!&#8221; And our hero held
up his hand. From a distance came a scraping
sound, like something sliding over a rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; called out the senator&#8217;s son. &#8220;He&#8217;s
got a boat! There he goes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave turned in the direction pointed out by his
chum. Both saw a small rowboat sweep out from
under some brushwood. In it stood the wild
man, using an oar as a pole on the rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried Dave. &#8220;Stop, or you may be
sorry for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t catch the King of Sumatra!&#8221;
yelled the wild man, and flourished his arms and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
made a hideous face at them. Then he sat down
on the middle seat of the craft, placed the oars in
the rowlocks, and commenced to row rapidly
down the stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the end of the chase,&#8221; remarked
Dave, in some disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, since we haven&#8217;t any boat,&#8221; returned
Roger. &#8220;Wonder where he got that
craft? I don&#8217;t think he bought it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely. Probably he saw it somewhere
along the river and simply appropriated it.&#8221; And
this proved to be true.</p>
<p>The boys watched the wild man until a bend of
the stream hid rower and craft from view. Then
they turned back in the direction of the old stone
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get him?&#8221; demanded Buster, who
was waiting with Gus at the point where he had
dropped out of the race.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Roger, and told why.</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure is a cute one,&#8221; went on the stout
youth. &#8220;Say, if they don&#8217;t catch him soon, he&#8217;ll
have this whole neighborhood scared to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>The students soon reached the old house.
Here they found the two girls and Phil, the latter
with a heavy stick in his hand, ready for any
emergency. The girls had calmed down a little,
but were still much agitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were to come home in my uncle&#8217;s carriage,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
said Mary Feversham. &#8220;But the horse
got a lame foot and so we decided to walk. We
had heard of the wild man, but did not think we
would meet him. Oh, it was dreadful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t hurt you, did he?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, but he frightened us so! He danced
around us and caught us by the arms, and he
wanted us to give him money! Oh, it was dreadful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to be in an asylum,&#8221; said Dave.
And then he and Roger related how the wild man
had escaped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t go out alone again,&#8221; said Vera
Rockwell. &#8220;That is, not until that man is captured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take you both home,&#8221; said Phil,
promptly, looking at Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t want to keep you from what
you were going to do,&#8221; said Vera.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we were only out for a walk,&#8221; replied
Dave. &#8220;We&#8217;ll walk to town with you. Maybe
we&#8217;ll hear something more of this strange fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>All turned back on the road that led close to
Oak Hall, and after discussing the wild man from
various points of view, the conversation turned
to other matters. The girls told of what they had
been doing during the past holidays and asked the
boys about themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that that horrid Jasniff is under arrest,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
said Vera to Dave. &#8220;I am glad of it. It
is a pity that Merwell got away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; answered our hero. &#8220;But, somehow,
I sometimes think that Link Merwell will
turn over a new leaf.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vera looked back, to make sure that none of the
others were near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like Mr. Plum, I suppose you mean,&#8221;
she whispered. &#8220;Oh, it was splendid, what you
did for him, Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t do much for Gus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother thinks you did. He heard the
whole story. It was brave and noble of you, it
was indeed!&#8221; And Vera&#8217;s face showed her earnestness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Gus has turned out a nice fellow. I
wish Merwell would turn out as good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he helped to take those jewels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true&mdash;and that will always be a black
mark against him,&#8221; said Dave, soberly.</p>
<p>Soon all reached the outskirts of Oakdale and
there, at one of the corners, the boys left the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty late!&#8221; cried Gus Plum, consulting the
watch he carried. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to hike back
lively, if we don&#8217;t want to be marked up for
tardiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can get an excuse, if we tell about the
wild man,&#8221; said Buster. &#8220;I&#8217;ve hurried all I&#8217;m
going to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll certainly have a yarn to spin when we
get back to the school,&#8221; was Phil&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the campus the boys, who
were a little late, met the first assistant to Doctor
Clay. As my old readers know Mr. Dale was
as pleasant as Job Haskers was disagreeable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had a fine walk, boys?&#8221; he asked, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had an adventure,&#8221; answered Dave, and
then he and his chums told what it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! well! that wild man again,&#8221; mused the
instructor. &#8220;This is getting truly serious. I was
hoping he would leave this neighborhood. And
so he calls himself the King of Sumatra? That
is strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is strange,&#8221; answered Dave.</p>
<p>But how strange, our hero was still to find out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>NAT POOLE WANTS TO KNOW</h3>
</div>
<p>That evening Dave was on his way to the
school library, to consult a certain work of reference,
when he ran into another student who suddenly
grasped him by the shoulder. It was rather
dark where the pair confronted each other, and
for the instant our hero did not recognize the
fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you for a minute, Dave
Porter,&#8221; said the other, in a voice that trembled
a trifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Nat,&#8221; answered Dave, as he
recognized the son of the Crumville money-lender.
&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; He rather
imagined that the youth wished to pick another
quarrel with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I want to talk in private with you,&#8221; returned
Nat, and looked around, to see if anybody
else was near.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were out walking this afternoon and met
that wild man, so I heard.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You tried to catch him, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Roger Morr, Buster Beggs, Gus Plum,
and I did our best to collar him, but he was
too fast for us. He ran down to the river, got
into a rowboat, and rowed away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I heard. And I heard something else,&#8221;
continued the boy from Crumville. &#8220;When you
called to the man to stop he answered back, didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you please tell me what he said?&#8221; And
Nat&#8217;s voice had an eager ring in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told us to beware and go back, or we&#8217;d
get into trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he say something more than that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, a great deal more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He called himself something, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Look here, Nat, what is this to you?
Why are you so interested?&#8221; queried Dave, for
he could easily perceive that the other youth was
more than ordinarily anxious to know the particulars
of what had occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;want to&mdash;er&mdash;know, that&#8217;s all. Did
he call himself anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he thinks he is the King of Sumatra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He called himself that?&#8221; asked Nat, with increased
excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, two or three times. But see here,
Nat&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you please tell me how he looked? Was
he tall and rather thin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what kind of hair did he have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brownish-red, as near as I could make out,
and very long. And he had rather a long beard
and a large nose,&#8221; went on our hero.</p>
<p>At this brief but accurate description of the
wild man, Nat Poole paled a trifle and uttered
something of a gasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whe&mdash;where did he go?&#8221; he faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He rowed down the river just as fast as he
could. I don&#8217;t know how far he went, for the
bend hid him from view,&#8221; answered our hero.
&#8220;Say, Nat, do you think you know that man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;know him? Of course I don&#8217;t
know him,&#8221; was the stammered-out reply. &#8220;But
I&mdash;I think&mdash;maybe&mdash;I&#8217;ve met him.&#8221; And then,
to avoid further questioning, Nat Poole hurried
away. Our hero could do nothing but stare
after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is mighty queer,&#8221; mused Dave, as he
turned into the library to consult the reference
book. &#8220;If Nat doesn&#8217;t know the man, why was
he so anxious? He acted scared to death when
I said the fellow called himself the King of
Sumatra.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Dave remained in the school library for a half
an hour and then joined Phil, Roger, and the
others in Dormitory Number Twelve. He found
the students discussing a talk Roger had had with
Nat Poole only a few minutes before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat called me out in the hallway,&#8221; said the
senator&#8217;s son. &#8220;He wanted to know all about
that wild man, and he wanted to make dead certain
that he had called himself the King of
Sumatra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is certainly queer&mdash;on top of what happened
to me,&#8221; said Dave, and told of the interview
he had had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is a puzzle,&#8221; declared Phil, slowly.
&#8220;What do you make of it, Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Nat imagines he knows the wild
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it looks to me,&#8221; added the
senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you don&#8217;t suppose that wild man has
anything to do with the fellows Nat used to
train with&mdash;Jasniff, Merwell, and that crowd?&#8221;
questioned Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s possible, but I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; returned
our hero. &#8220;He is surely a crazy individual, and
as nobody around here seems to know him, he
must be a stranger to these parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what would make Nat so interested?&#8221;
asked little Chip Macklin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up,&#8221; answered Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he has something to tell, but won&#8217;t tell
it to us,&#8221; ventured Phil. &#8220;He may go right to
the doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if Nat Poole went to the master of Oak
Hall, or to anybody else at that institution, the
boys did not hear of it. He asked no more questions
about the wild man, and when any of our
friends came near him he immediately walked
away, thus avoiding an interview.</p>
<p>The proposed meeting of the athletic committee
of Oak Hall was held on Saturday afternoon in
the gymnasium and was well attended. An even
twenty names had been put up for the regular
baseball nine of the institution. Of these names,
fifteen belonged to old students and five were
those of newcomers to Oak Hall. As he had said
he would do, Gus Plum had handed in his name,
and so had Sam Day and some of our other
friends. But Dave, Phil, and Roger were conspicuous
by their absence.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Porter, you&#8217;re going to play, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221; asked the former manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Dave, quietly but firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place, I have too many back
lessons to make up, and in the second place, I hope
to graduate this coming June, and I want to make
a record for myself, if possible.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you can do that and play on the nine,
too,&#8221; urged the manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;d like to play,&#8221; continued
our hero, wistfully, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see how I
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t fair, Porter. We really need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t as bad as that,&#8221; returned Dave,
with a faint smile. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got Gus Plum to
pitch, and some of the others. There are plenty
of good ball-players here this term.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; answered the manager,
with a grave shake of his head. &#8220;I wish
you&#8217;d come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not this year,&#8221; said Dave; and then the two
separated.</p>
<p>Phil and Roger were likewise urged to try for
the nine, but they followed Dave&#8217;s example.
Then a tentative nine was formed, with Gus Plum
as pitcher, and also a &#8220;scrub&#8221; nine, with one of
the newcomers to Oak Hall in the box. Practice
was to start on Wednesday afternoon of the
following week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad we couldn&#8217;t take part,&#8221; sighed the
shipowner&#8217;s son. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to wallop the Rockville
Military Academy fellows just once more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t have everything,&#8221; answered
Dave. &#8220;I want to graduate with the highest possible
honors, and that means plenty of hard
boning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And a fellow can&#8217;t bone and play ball, too,&#8221;
added Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might&mdash;if old Haskers would be easy
on us,&#8221; murmured the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see here, Phil,&#8221; said Dave, almost
sternly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask Haskers for any more favors.
He has done all that can reasonably be
expected of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, just as you say,&#8221; grumbled Phil.
But his manner showed that he was not altogether
satisfied.</p>
<p>A week went by, and Dave and his chums applied
themselves diligently to their studies. During
that time nothing more was heard of the wild
man, and the excitement concerning that strange
individual again died down. But the folks living
in the vicinity of the woods back of Oak Hall
were on their guard, and it was seldom that
women and children went out alone.</p>
<p>The boys were doing very well in their studies,
and Dave received warm words of encouragement
from Andrew Dale. He had made up nearly all
the back lessons imposed upon him by Job Haskers,
and that dictatorial teacher could not help
but be satisfied over the showing made. Roger
was also doing well, and poor Phil was the only
one who was backward, although not enough to
cause alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get there, but it comes hard,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
shipowner&#8217;s son. &#8220;I should have asked old Haskers
for more time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it,&#8221; answered Dave. &#8220;Come,
I&#8217;ll help you all I can.&#8221; Which he did.</p>
<p>One day there came a letter to our hero which
gave him great satisfaction. He read it carefully,
and then hastened off to communicate the
news to Phil, Roger, and Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a letter from my Uncle Dunston,&#8221; he
explained to his chums. &#8220;If you will remember,
he said he would hire a lawyer to take up
that Mrs. Breen case against Professor Haskers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he say?&#8221; asked Roger, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will read it to you,&#8221; answered Dave, and
read the following:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;You will be glad to learn that Mr. Loveland,
one of our lawyers, has gotten a settlement for
Mrs. Breen out of your teacher, Mr. Haskers.
He had quite a time of it, Haskers declaring that
he did not owe as much as the widow said he did.
The lawyer said he would sue for the full amount,
and then Haskers came to see him. Mr. Loveland
says the teacher wanted to learn who had
hired him to stir the matter up, and mentioned
some students&#8217; names. But the lawyer gave him
no satisfaction at all, and at last Haskers paid up
in full, took his receipt, and got out. I instructed
Mr. Loveland to put his charges for services on
our bill, so Mrs. Breen will get the entire amount
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
collected. I am going to take it to her in person,
and see to it that it is wisely invested for her
benefit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried the senator&#8217;s son. &#8220;That will
help the old lady a great deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ll bet old Haskers was sore when he
forked over that money,&#8221; was Ben&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;No wonder he&#8217;s been looking like a thundercloud
lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and he&#8217;d let out on us&mdash;if he dared,&#8221;
said Phil. &#8220;But he doesn&#8217;t dare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure of that, Phil,&#8221; said Dave,
seriously. &#8220;There is no telling what he will do&mdash;later
on, when he thinks this affair has blown
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! I am not afraid of him,&#8221; declared
Phil, recklessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he tries any of his games we&#8217;ll expose him,&#8221;
added Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better go slow,&#8221; advised Roger. He, too,
felt that Job Haskers might become very vindictive.</p>
<p>Spring was now at hand, and a week later came
the first baseball game of the season. It was a
contest with Esmore Academy from Daytonville
and held on the Oak Hall grounds. Quite a
crowd was present, including some of the town
folks. Gus Plum was in the pitcher&#8217;s box for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
Hall, and Sam Day was on first base, and Chip
Macklin on third.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we win!&#8221; cried Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you do,&#8221; answered Vera Rockwell,
who was present with some other girls. &#8220;But
why are you not playing?&#8221; she went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not this term,&#8221; said our hero, with a smile,
and then he spoke of his studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is noble of you to give up this
way,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But&mdash;I&#8217;d like to see you play.&#8221;</p>
<p>The contest proved a well-fought one, and was
won by Oak Hall by a score of eight runs to five.
At the conclusion there was a great cheering for
the victors.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means bonfires to-night!&#8221; cried Roger,
as the gathering broke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and a grand good time!&#8221; added Buster
Beggs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>BONFIRE NIGHT AT THE HALL</h3>
</div>
<p>It was certainly a night long to be remembered
in the annals of Oak Hall,&mdash;and for more
reasons than one.</p>
<p>At the start, several bonfires were lit along the
bank of the river, and around these the students
congregated, to dance and sing songs, and &#8220;cut
up&#8221; generally. None of the teachers were present,
and it was given out that the lads might
enjoy themselves within reasonable bounds until
ten o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s form a grand march!&#8221; cried Gus Plum.
&#8220;Every man with a torch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but don&#8217;t set anything on fire,&#8221; cautioned
Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that puts me in mind of a story,&#8221; came
from Shadow. &#8220;A fellow went into a powder
shop to buy some ammunition. He was smoking a
pipe, and the proprietor&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoop! Hurrah for Shadow!&#8221; yelled somebody
from the rear, and the next instant the
story-teller of the Hall found himself up on a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
pile of barrels which had not yet been set on
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, tell your yarns to everybody!&#8221;
came the cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak loud, Shadow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us all the details.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us the story about the old man and the
elephant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, give us that about the old maid and the
mouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hear about the fellow who was shipwrecked
on the Rocky Mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or about how the fellow who couldn&#8217;t swim
fell into a flour barrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what do you take me for?&#8221; roared
Shadow. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know any story about the
Rocky Mountains, or a flour barrel either. If you
want to hear&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure we do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the very yarn we&#8217;ve been waiting
for!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Shadow, won&#8217;t you please tell it into a
phonograph, so I can grind it out to my grandfather
when I get home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the story that starts on a foggy night,
at noon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, this one starts on a dusty day in the middle
of the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, if you fellows want me to tell a story, say
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
so!&#8221; grumbled Shadow. &#8220;Otherwise I&#8217;m going
to get down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! no! Tell your best yarn, Shadow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then. Once two men went into a
shoe store&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow! That&#8217;s fifty years old!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that when a child, at my grandson&#8217;s
knee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us something about smoke, Shadow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And fire. I love to hear about a fire. It&#8217;s
so warm and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! let me get down! Do you want to burn
me up?&#8221; yelled the story-teller of the school,
suddenly, as, chancing to glance down, he saw
that the barrels were on fire. &#8220;Let me down, I
say!&#8221; And he made a leap from the barrels
into the midst of the crowd.</p>
<p>Shadow landed on the shoulders of Nat Poole,
and both went down and rolled over. In a spirit
of play some of the students near by covered the
rolling pair with shavings and straw. Shadow
took this in good part and merely laughed as he
arose, but the money-lender&#8217;s son was angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, who threw those dirty shavings all over
me?&#8221; he bawled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind a little bath like that, Nat!&#8221;
called one of the students.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do mind it. The shavings are full of
dirt, and so is the straw. The dirt is all over me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, you can have a free bath, Nat,&#8221;
said another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lend you a cake of soap,&#8221; added a third.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any of your soap!&#8221; growled the
money-lender&#8217;s son. &#8220;Say, the whole crowd of
you make me sick!&#8221; he added, and walked off, in
great disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phew! but he&#8217;s touchy,&#8221; was the comment of
one of the students. &#8220;I guess he thinks he&#8217;s better
than the rest of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s give him another dose,&#8221; came the suggestion,
from the rear of the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shavings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and straw, too. Put some down his
neck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fully a dozen students quickly provided themselves
with shavings and straw, both far from
clean, and made after Nat, who was walking
up the river-front in the direction of the boathouse.</p>
<p>Before the money-lender&#8217;s son could do anything
to defend himself, he found himself seized
from behind and hurled to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, give it to him good!&#8221; cried a
voice, and in a twinkling a shower of shavings,
straw, and dirt descended upon poor Nat, covering
him from head to foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! let up!&#8221; spluttered the victim, trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
dodge the avalanche. But instead of heeding his
pleadings the other students proceeded to ram a
quantity of the stuff into his ears and down his
collar. Nat squirmed and yelled, but it did little
good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, you are initiated into the Order
of Straw and Shavings!&#8221; cried one merry student.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just you wait, I&#8217;ll get square, see if I don&#8217;t,&#8221;
howled Nat, as he arose. Then he commenced to
twist his neck, to free himself from the ticklish
straw and shavings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on and have a good time, old sport!&#8221;
howled one of his tormentors; and then off the
crowd ran in the direction of the bonfires, leaving
Nat more disgusted than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix them, just wait and see if I don&#8217;t!&#8221;
stormed the money-lender&#8217;s son to himself, and
then hurried to the Hall, to clean up and make
himself comfortable.</p>
<p>In the meantime the march around the campus
had begun, each student carrying a torch of some
kind. There was a great singing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful of the fire,&#8221; warned Mr. Dale, as
he came out. &#8220;Doctor Clay says you must be
careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take care!&#8221; was the cry.</p>
<p>The marching at an end, some of the boys ran
for the stables and presently returned with Jackson
Lemond, the driver of the school carryall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
commonly called Horsehair, because of the hairs
which clung to his clothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Horsehair, join us in having a
good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us a speech, Horsehair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us all you know about the Wars of the
Roses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or how Hannibal crossed the Delaware and
defeated the Turks at the Alamo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make no speech,&#8221; pleaded the carryall
driver. &#8220;Just you let me go, please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t make a speech, sing,&#8221; suggested
another. &#8220;Give us Yankee Doodle in the key
of J minor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or that beautiful lullaby entitled, &#8216;You
Never Miss Your Purse Until You Have to Walk
Home.&#8217; Give us that in nine flats, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I can&#8217;t make a speech and I can&#8217;t
sing!&#8221; shouted out the driver for the school, desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;How sad! Can&#8217;t speechify and can&#8217;t sing!
All right, then, let it go, and give us a
dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk! A real Japanese jig in five-quarter
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rush, and in a twinkling poor
Horsehair was boosted to the top of a big packing-case,
that had been hauled to the spot as fuel
for one of the bonfires.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The stage!&#8221; announced one of the students,
with a wave of his hand. &#8220;The World-Renowned
Horsehairsky will perform his celebrated Dance
of the Hop Scotch. Get your opera glasses
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the admission fee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two pins and a big green apple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t dance&mdash;I ain&#8217;t never danced in my
life!&#8221; pleaded the victim. &#8220;You let me go.
I&#8217;ve got to take care o&#8217; my hosses.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he was speaking Buster Beggs had come
up behind Horsehair and placed something attached
to a dark string on the box, between the
driver&#8217;s feet. It was an imitation snake, made of
rubber and colored up to look very natural.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my, look at the snake!&#8221; yelled several,
in pretended alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where? where?&#8221; yelled Horsehair.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, right between your feet! He&#8217;s going
to bite you on the leg!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care, that&#8217;s a rattler sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he bites you, Horsehair, you&#8217;ll be a dead
man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him off! Take him off!&#8221; bawled the
carryall driver, and in terror he made a wild leap
from the packing-box and landed directly on the
shoulders of two of the students. Then he
dropped to the ground, rolled over, got up, and
ran as fast as his legs could carry him in the direction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
of the stables. A wild laugh followed him,
but to this he paid no attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are certainly having a night of it,&#8221;
remarked Dave, after the fun had quieted down
for a moment. He spoke to Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Phil?&#8221; asked the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Went off with Ben, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer how much they keep together
lately; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; continued Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Of course that affair
with Haskers may have something to do with it,&#8221;
answered our hero, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish Haskers would leave this school,
Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it won&#8217;t make much difference to us, if
we graduate, whether he stays or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that. But, somehow, I don&#8217;t think
he is a good man to have here, even if he is a
learned instructor. He never enters into the
school spirit, as Mr. Dale does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t all be alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you keep him, if you were in Doctor
Clay&#8217;s shoes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think so. Certainly not if I could
find another teacher equally good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys walked on until they found themselves
at the last bonfire of the line, close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
to where the school grounds came to an end.
Here was a hedge, and beyond were the woods
reaching up from the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody down by this bonfire,&#8221; remarked
Dave. &#8220;Say, this is careless work,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;The wind might shift and set the woods on
fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d start a fire so far from
the others,&#8221; answered his chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us kick it into the water,&#8221; suggested our
hero, and this they started to do, when, unexpectedly,
a voice hailed them, and they saw a student
sitting in a tree that grew in the hedge which
separated the campus from the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let that fire alone!&#8221; the youth called, angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Nat Poole!&#8221; exclaimed Roger, in
a low voice. &#8220;Whatever is he doing in that
tree?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear what I say?&#8221; went on the
money-lender&#8217;s son. &#8220;Leave that fire alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you build it?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, and I want you to leave it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Nat, if you say so,&#8221; answered
Roger. &#8220;We thought it had been abandoned and
that it might set fire to the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this Nat Poole did not reply. Plainly he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
was annoyed at being discovered in his present
position. Dave and Roger looked around, to see
if anybody else was in the vicinity, and then,
turning, walked in the direction of the other bonfires.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of that, Dave?&#8221; asked
the senator&#8217;s son, presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looked to me as if Nat was waiting or
watching for somebody, Roger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it did. The question is, Who was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;ve got something of an
idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the students?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. That wild man.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>PLANS FOR A SPREAD</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;That wild man?&#8221; exclaimed the senator&#8217;s
son, stopping short to stare at Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you make that out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I think Nat is interested in the fellow,
although just how I won&#8217;t pretend to say.
But you&#8217;ll remember how excited he got when he
found out that the wild man called himself the
King of Sumatra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. You think he knows the fellow
and thought that the bonfire might attract him to
the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ve heard it said that crazy folks were
sometimes attracted by the sight of fire. Maybe
Nat has heard the same and wants to see if it will
work in the case of this man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we go back and see what happens?&#8221;
suggested Roger.</p>
<p>Dave mused for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be just right to play the spy,
Roger?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this isn&#8217;t playing the spy in the ordinary
sense of the term, Dave. That wild man
ought to be locked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it may not be the wild man he is looking
for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let us go back a little while, anyway,&#8221;
urged the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>They retraced their steps until within fifty feet
of the bonfire and then walked to the shelter of
the hedge. They thought they had not been seen,
but they were mistaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! so you think you are going to spy
on me, after all!&#8221; cried a voice, and Nat Poole
came towards them, with a deep frown on his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather queer you are in the tree,&#8221; answered
Roger, somewhat sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my affair, not yours, Roger Morr!&#8221;
roared the money-lender&#8217;s son. Then, without
another word, he walked to the bonfire, kicked
the blazing sticks into the river, and strode off
in the direction of the Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s good and mad,&#8221; was Roger&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we didn&#8217;t learn anything, after all,&#8221;
added our hero.</p>
<p>Dave and his chum rejoined the merry throng
at the other bonfires. But the celebration in
honor of the baseball victory was practically at
an end, and a little later the students retired, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
skylark a little in the dormitories, and then settle
down for the night.</p>
<p>A week passed, and Dave stuck to his studies
as persistently as ever. During that time he sent
off several letters, and received a number in return,
including one from Jessie, which he treasured
very highly and which he did not show to his
chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is news of Link Merwell,&#8221; said Luke
Watson, one day, as he came along with a letter.
&#8220;It&#8217;s from a friend of mine who knows Merwell.
He says he saw Link in Quebec, Canada, at one
of the little French hotels in the lower town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was Merwell doing?&#8221; questioned
Dave, with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much, so my friend writes. He says
Link was dressed in a blue suit and wore blue
glasses, and he thought his hair was dyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently doing what he could to disguise
himself,&#8221; was Phil&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend writes that he saw Merwell only
one evening. The next day he was missing. He
made inquiries and says he was at the hotel under
the name of V. A. Smith, of Albany, New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not dare to travel around under his
own name,&#8221; remarked Shadow. &#8220;Say, that puts
me in mind of a story,&#8221; he went on, brightening
up. &#8220;Once a chap changed his name, because&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, cut it out,&#8221; interrupted Phil. &#8220;We want
to hear about Merwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any more to tell,&#8221; said Luke.
&#8220;My friend tried to find out where he had gone
but couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be having a lonely time of it&mdash;trying
to keep out of the hands of the law,&#8221; murmured
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;And maybe he hasn&#8217;t much money,&#8221; said
Buster. &#8220;His father may have shut down on
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gus Plum listened to all this conversation without
saying a word. But down in his heart the
former bully of Oak Hall was glad that he had
cut away from Merwell and Jasniff, and turned
over a new leaf, and he resolved then and there
that, come what might, he would never again turn
aside from the path of right and honor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, why don&#8217;t you listen to my story?&#8221;
pleaded Shadow, and then related a somewhat
rambling tale of a man who had changed his
name and, later on, lost some property because
of it.</p>
<p>Another day slipped by and it was one of particular
interest to Dave and Roger, for in the morning
they made up the last of the back lessons
imposed upon them by Job Haskers. They had
done exceedingly well, but the harsh teacher gave
them little credit. Phil and Ben had still three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
days&#8217; work, but Professor Haskers said nothing
of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t dare,&#8221; declared the shipowner&#8217;s
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; chuckled Ben. &#8220;We could
give him a good black eye before this whole
school if we wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave had already finished up the back lessons
for the other teachers, so he was now free to
spend his time on what was ahead of him. He
was as enthusiastic as ever to make a record for
himself, and pitched in with a will, and his enthusiasm
was caught by Roger, who also resolved to
do his best.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoop! hurrah! What do you think of
this?&#8221; came from Phil, late one afternoon, after
the mail had been distributed. &#8220;Somebody hold
me down! I guess I&#8217;m going to fly! Or maybe
I&#8217;m only dreaming!&#8221; And he began to caper
around gayly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it all about, Phil?&#8221; asked Dave.
&#8220;Hit your funny-bone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money, boys, money! That&#8217;s what it is
about,&#8221; replied the shipowner&#8217;s son. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
five thousand dollars, all my own!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five thousand dollars!&#8221; gasped Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;All your own?&#8221; queried Gus Plum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221; asked another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s this way,&#8221; answered Phil, when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
could calm down a little. &#8220;About two years ago
a great-uncle of mine died, leaving considerable
money. He was interested in various enterprises
and his death brought on legal complications and
some litigation. He left his money to a lot of
heirs, including myself. My father and I never
thought we&#8217;d get anything&mdash;thought the lawyers
and courts would swallow it all. But now it seems
that it has been settled, and yours truly gets five
thousand dollars in cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you get it, Phil, right away?&#8221; asked
Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&mdash;er&mdash;I, of course, don&#8217;t get it until I
am of age. It&#8217;s to go in the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you get any of it until then?&#8221; asked
Shadow. &#8220;Your dad might let you have a little,
just to celebrate&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it&mdash;just what he has done!&#8221; cried
Phil. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got&#8211;&#8211; But wait,&#8221; cried the shipowner&#8217;s
son, interrupting himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll plan this
thing out. You shall all be my guests later on,&#8221;
he added, mysteriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you give a spread?&#8221; asked Chip
Macklin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask questions, only wait,&#8221; returned
Phil. And that was all he would say on the point,
although he talked freely about his inheritance.</p>
<p>The next morning Phil and Ben were seen in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
earnest conversation, and that afternoon the two
boys left the school as soon as they could get
away, bound on an errand to Oakdale.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to get a dandy spread for a dollar
or a dollar and a half a head,&#8221; said Phil, as they
hurried along. &#8220;And twelve at a dollar and a
half will be only eighteen dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The music will cost something,&#8221; said Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m counting on two pieces, a harp and
a violin, for ten dollars. That&#8217;s the price Professor
Smuller charges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys were bound for the Oakdale Union
House, a new hotel which had just been opened
by a man named Jason Sparr. It was a nice
resort, without a bar, and catered to the better
class of people, including the students at Oak
Hall and at the Military Academy.</p>
<p>The boys found the hotel proprietor glad to
see them, and willing to set any kind of a spread
that they were able to pay for. Trade was not
yet brisk, and Jason Sparr said he would do his
best to serve them. He was a smooth, oily man,
and a fellow who wanted all that was coming to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can set you an elegant table for eighteen
dollars for twelve,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you oysters,
fish, two kinds of meat, several vegetables,
salad, ice-cream, coffee, and also nuts, cake, olives,
celery, and other fixings.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk!&#8221; cried Phil, enthusiastically.
&#8220;Just make a nice spread of it, and you can have
all our trade in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be well pleased,&#8221; answered Jason
Sparr.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we have a private dining-room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure&mdash;the blue room over yonder,&#8221; and
the hotel man showed the boys the apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want some flowers, too,&#8221; said Phil. &#8220;You
can put two dollars&#8217; worth of roses on the
table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well&mdash;that will make an even twenty
dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you want me to pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such spreads are usually paid for in advance,&#8221;
answered Jason Sparr, shrewdly. He did
not intend to take any chances with schoolboys.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, here is your money,&#8221; answered the
shipowner&#8217;s son, and brought forth one of the
two crisp twenty-dollar bills his father had mailed
to him, with the good news of his fortune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him about the music,&#8221; suggested Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I thought I&#8217;d have Professor
Smuller furnish some music&mdash;harp and violin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine! They can sit in the alcove, and we&#8217;ll
put some of our palms around them,&#8221; returned
Jason Sparr.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, this is for next Saturday night,
seven o&#8217;clock sharp,&#8221; said Phil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it down,&#8221; returned the hotel proprietor,
as he wrote in his book.</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t say anything to anybody about it.
I want to surprise my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, mum&#8217;s the word,&#8221; and the hotel
man looked very wise and knowing.</p>
<p>Leaving the place, Phil and Ben sought out the
home of Professor Smuller, a violinist, who, with
a friend who played the harp, often furnished
music for dances and other occasions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I can furnish music,&#8221; said the
violinist. &#8220;Just tell me what you want.&#8221; Business
was slow and he was glad to get any sort of
an engagement.</p>
<p>The matter was explained, and the professor
promised to be on hand and bring the harpist
with him. He said he could play anything the
students desired, including the well-known school
songs. He would fill the engagement for the boys
for eight dollars, although his regular price was
ten. But he would have to have cash in advance.</p>
<p>Again Phil paid out his money, and then, the
business concluded, he and Ben left the professor&#8217;s
home and hurried along the road leading to Oak
Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you made up your list yet?&#8221; asked
Ben, when nearing the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite. I&#8217;ll have Dave and Roger and
Shadow and Buster, of course. I&#8217;ll have to leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
out some fellows, but that can&#8217;t be helped. I
can&#8217;t afford a spread for the whole school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll have Luke and Sam, and maybe
Gus and Chip.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the boys drew closer to the school Ben had
to stop to fix his shoe. Both sat down on some
rocks, at a turn in the road. They were about
to go on again when somebody made the turn
of the road, coming from the town. It was Nat
Poole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! you been to town?&#8221; cried Ben, good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the money-lender&#8217;s son.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I a right to go if I want to?&#8221; he
added, and then hurried on ahead of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather peppery,&#8221; mused Ben. &#8220;Say, Phil,
there is one fellow you won&#8217;t invite, and I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Ben,&#8221; was the ready answer.
&#8220;All I ask of Nat Poole is, that he leave me
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Nat was not to leave Phil alone, as events
were quickly to prove.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE CABIN ON THE ISLAND</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dave, come on out for a row. You haven&#8217;t
been on the river this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Gus Plum who spoke. He was out in
one of the craft belonging to Oak Hall, and hailed
our hero as the latter was strolling along the
river-bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Gus!&#8221; Dave cried, cheerily. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know but that a try at the oars will do me
good, after the hard studying I&#8217;ve been doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are bound to get a high-water mark this
term, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; went on Gus Plum, as he
brought the rowboat up to the dock, so that Dave
might get in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to graduate with honor, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do after you leave
here, Dave?&#8221; went on the big youth, as the
two rowed up the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet. Have you made up your
mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think I&#8217;ll go into business, but I am not
sure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t try for college?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You see, I don&#8217;t make much of a fist at
learning, so what&#8217;s the use? But I love business&mdash;buying
and selling things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two boys continued at the oars until the
vicinity of Oak Hall was left far behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we only had a power-boat we might run
up to Squirrel Island,&#8221; remarked Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Nat Poole will lend you his motor-boat,&#8221;
suggested our hero, with a little grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! I&#8217;d not ask him,&#8221; returned the big
youth, promptly. &#8220;I am done with Nat Poole.
I want to stick to my new friends.&#8221; And the
former bully of the school fairly beamed on
Dave, who had done so much to make him reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen the motor-boat this season,
Gus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Nat got it out two days ago. I think
he is on the river now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys rowed on, until they came to a bend
where there was something of a cove. As they
rounded the point they heard the steady put-put!
of a gasoline engine not far off.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is Nat&#8217;s craft now!&#8221; cried our hero,
and pointed ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all alone,&#8221; was Plum&#8217;s comment. &#8220;He
can&#8217;t have many friends these days, or he&#8217;d have
some of them along.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to be without friends, Gus, shouldn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed! But it&#8217;s Nat&#8217;s own fault. If
he&#8217;d only drop his important airs and be more
sociable, he&#8217;d get along all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>On and on rowed the two students. It was
a clear, balmy day, and they hated to return to
the school until it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us row around Smith Island,&#8221; suggested
our hero, mentioning a small place in the middle
of the stream, so named after a farmer who
owned it. It was a rocky and somewhat barren
spot, and seldom visited by anybody but fishermen.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, but we want to beware of the
rocks,&#8221; cautioned the big youth.</p>
<p>The rowboat was headed up the stream, and
soon they came in sight of the island. On one
side were a number of bushes, overhanging the
river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! look there!&#8221; cried Dave, a few minutes
later, and pointed to the bushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A motor-boat. I think it is Nat Poole&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? What brought him here?&#8221; questioned
Gus, with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know. But it&#8217;s his boat,
I am sure of that,&#8221; went on Dave, after another
look at the craft.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;See anything of Nat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the boat is empty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us row in a little closer and see what he
is doing,&#8221; suggested Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll say we were spying on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Haven&#8217;t we as much right as he
has to visit the island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what is the use of keeping away? He
may be waiting to play some trick, or something
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think not, Gus. Probably he just
visited the island out of curiosity. But I&#8217;ll go in
if you say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly, so as to avoid the many rocks in that
vicinity, the two students brought the rowboat
close up to the motor-craft. They looked into the
bushes and along the rocks beyond, but saw nothing
of Nat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we call to him?&#8221; asked Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for? I don&#8217;t want to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I. His boat is tied good and
fast. He must expect to stay on the island quite
a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two boys rowed on, past the motor-boat.
Then, as they turned a point of rocks, Dave
gave a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of all things!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Dave?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look yonder&mdash;in between those bushes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a rowboat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly, Gus, and do you see how it is painted,
drab with blue stripes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;a pretty ugly boat, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gus, that is the very rowboat used by that
wild man&mdash;the one he was in when he got away
from us that day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really mean it?&#8221; gasped the big boy,
staring hard at the craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do&mdash;I&#8217;d know that boat in a hundred.
I never saw another just like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, maybe the wild man is on
the island!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I was thinking,&#8221; answered Dave.
&#8220;And I was thinking, too, that&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; He stopped
short.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember how Nat was so anxious
to know all about the wild man? And how upset
he seemed to be when he heard that the fellow
called himself the King of Sumatra?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember that. Do you think he
came here to find the man?&#8221; demanded Gus,
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks so to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious, Dave, I think you are right!
Say, there is something mysterious about all
this!&#8221; cried Gus.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go ashore by all means and see what
Nat is up to,&#8221; urged the big youth.</p>
<p>Dave was more than willing, now that he had
discovered the rowboat used by the wild man.
Perhaps this island was the home of that mysterious
individual. If so, what was the money-lender&#8217;s
son doing there? Had he business with
the strange creature?</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;d better not make any noise,&#8221; suggested
Gus, as the boat was turned in to a convenient
landing-place. To this Dave did not
reply, but they landed as silently as possible.
Then the rowboat was hauled up out of sight
between the bushes.</p>
<p>From the craft used by the wild man a rude
path ran up from the shore to the rocks beyond.
A short distance from the shore the boys saw the
marks of a wet foot, coming from the direction
where lay the motor-boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was made by Nat&mdash;he got his left foot
wet,&#8221; said Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so myself,&#8221; answered our hero.</p>
<p>They followed the marks left by the wet foot
over the rocks. They headed for the upper end
of the island, where there was a small grove of
straggly cedar trees. Here the marks faded
away completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we know he came this way, anyhow,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
remarked Gus. &#8220;He can&#8217;t be very far off, for
the island isn&#8217;t very big.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a rude log cabin!&#8221; exclaimed Dave,
and pointed through the cedars. &#8220;Maybe that is
where the wild man lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it is, we want to go slow, Dave. He may
attack us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what of Nat, if he is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may know the man and have some influence
over him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think anybody could have any influence
over that man. He is as crazy as can be,
and not to be trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two youths approached the old log cabin
slowly, keeping as much as possible in the shelter
of the trees. Nobody was in sight, nor did any
sound reach their ears.</p>
<p>Presently the students found themselves within
fifty feet of the cabin, the door of which stood
half open. Each looked at the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going ahead,&#8221; said Dave, resolutely. He
and his companion had provided themselves with
sticks, and Gus had also picked up two stones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! oh! oh!&#8221; came of a sudden, to their
startled ears. &#8220;Oh dear me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Nat!&#8221; ejaculated Dave. &#8220;Something
has happened to him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the wild man attacked him,&#8221; added
Gus.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon see,&#8221; cried Dave, and started forward
on a run.</p>
<p>Soon our hero was at the door of the cabin,
which he pushed wide open. Inside all was dark,
for it was growing late, and the rude structure
boasted of but one small window, stuffed with
cedar boughs to keep out the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat, where are you?&#8221; cried Dave, as his eyes
sought to pierce the semi-darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who is that calling me?&#8221; came, in surprise,
from the center of the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I&mdash;Dave Porter! Where are you, and
what happened? Where is the wild man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m caught fast&mdash;in a trap!&#8221; groaned the
money-lender&#8217;s son. &#8220;Oh, help me out! My
ankle is almost broken!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the wild man&mdash;?&#8221; queried Gus, who was
close behind our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know where he is,&#8221; gasped Nat.
&#8220;Oh, say, won&#8217;t you please help me? My ankle
is fast in a trap! Oh, how it hurts!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t the wild man here?&#8221; asked Dave, as
he got out his match-box to strike a light.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;at least, I haven&#8217;t seen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave soon had a match lit, and with it set
fire to a cedar bough placed in the rude fireplace
of the cabin. By the glare of this light he and
Gus looked around them and at their fellow-student.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>The cabin was unfurnished excepting for a rude
bench and a board placed on some piles of stones
for a table. In the fireplace were a kettle and a
frying-pan, and on the table the remains of a
scanty meal of crackers, eggs, and apples. A tin
pail, half filled with water, was also handy.</p>
<p>When Dave and Gus turned their attention to
Nat Poole they had to stare in wonder. Nat sat
on the floor, nursing a bruised ankle that was
caught fast between the jaws of an old-fashioned
steel animal-trap. The trap was chained to the
floor, and the release chain ran to a corner of
the fireplace, several feet beyond the sufferer&#8217;s
reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;However did this happen?&#8221; asked Gus, although
he and our hero could easily guess the
answer to the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me get loose first,&#8221; groaned poor Nat.
&#8220;This thing is sawing down to the bone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave saw the release chain, which was held
firm by a hook. Stepping over, he unhooked
it, and then it was an easy matter to pry the jaws
of the steel-trap apart. As soon as this was done,
Nat rose slowly to his feet, making a wry face
as he did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be lame for life&mdash;I know I will!&#8221; he
groaned. &#8220;Oh dear, how it hurts!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You take care that you don&#8217;t get blood-poisoning
from it,&#8221; warned Gus. &#8220;When you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
get home wash it well, and put some peroxide
of hydrogen, or something like that on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood-poisoning! Oh dear!&#8221; and Nat gave
another groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we help you back to your boat?&#8221; asked
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the wild man?&#8221; questioned Gus,
looking around.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, and I don&#8217;t care&mdash;just now,&#8221;
answered Nat Poole.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEF</h3>
</div>
<p>Nat Poole could hardly walk on the injured
leg, so Dave and Gus supported him as the three
left the rude cabin and headed for the shore of the
island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where the wild man is?&#8221; repeated
Gus, who had not been satisfied by the
reply given to the question before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not,&#8221; snapped the money-lender&#8217;s son,
with a touch of his former tartness. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
seen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know that cabin is where he lives,&#8221;
put in our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so&mdash;but I wasn&#8217;t sure of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see him come ashore, Nat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;that is, not to-day. I saw him land here
yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is what brought you here to-day?&#8221;
remarked Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you must know,&#8221; was the somewhat
cold answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Nat, do you know this wild man?&#8221;
asked Dave, abruptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Know him? How should I know
him?&#8221; demanded the money-lender&#8217;s son, but his
apparent astonishment did not, somehow, ring
nor look true.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I wanted to find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know him&mdash;at least, I don&#8217;t think I
do. I&#8217;ve never seen him close enough to make
sure. Maybe he&#8217;s some fellow who belongs
around here. I wanted to find out about him&mdash;just
as everybody else wants to find out, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to have him caught and placed in an
asylum?&#8221; asked Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not my business to place him anywhere,&#8221;
cried Nat, hastily. &#8220;For all we know, he may
be harmless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not when he stops young ladies on the road
and catches folks in steel-traps,&#8221; answered our
hero, with a faint smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s right, too,&#8221; grumbled the money-lender&#8217;s
son. &#8220;Maybe he ought to be in an
asylum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is on this island now,&#8221; went on
Dave. &#8220;His rowboat is here, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ll tell you what we can do!&#8221; cried Gus.
&#8220;Take his boat with us! Then he can&#8217;t get
away, and we can send the authorities over here
to get him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an idea, Gus!&#8221; cried Dave. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
do it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Would that be fair to the man?&#8221; asked Nat.
&#8220;He&mdash;er&mdash;he might starve to death&mdash;or try to
swim to shore and get drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t starve to death in one night, and I
don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll drown himself. The authorities
can come over here early in the morning and
round him up, if he is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;er&mdash;I don&#8217;t think much of your plan,&#8221;
murmured Nat, and seemed much disturbed.</p>
<p>In about a quarter of an hour the boys reached
the island shore, at the spot where Nat&#8217;s motor-boat
was tied up. They helped him get in and
start up the engine. He had been told how
they had come to the island.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to, you can tie your boat
fast to the stern and ride back with me,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Nat, we&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; answered Dave.
&#8220;It is getting rather late and it&#8217;s a pretty stiff
row to the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>The motor-craft was started up and sent along
in the direction where the boys had left the Oak
Hall rowboat. Their course took them past the
spot where the wild man&#8217;s boat had been tied up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, look, it&#8217;s gone!&#8221; cried Gus, standing
up and pointing to the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;True enough,&#8221; answered our hero. &#8220;He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
must have gone off in it while we were up to the
cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t be very far away, Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys looked up and down the river, but
could catch no trace of the missing rowboat or
the wild man. In the meantime, the motor-craft
was moving forward, where the other boat had
been beached among the bushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is gone, too!&#8221; ejaculated Dave. &#8220;He
has taken our boat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do you really think so?&#8221; asked Gus.
He felt that he was responsible for the craft, as
he had taken it from the school boathouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do think so,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;It
was a neat trick to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder he didn&#8217;t take the motor-boat,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he didn&#8217;t know how to run the boat
and it was too heavy to start without the engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you are right!&#8221; came suddenly from
Nat. &#8220;Look here!&#8221;</p>
<p>He had stooped down to pick something up
from the grating on the motor-boat&#8217;s bottom. If
was a torn and dirty bandanna handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wild man&#8217;s!&#8221; cried Dave. &#8220;I remember
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad he didn&#8217;t get away with my boat,&#8221;
returned the money-lender&#8217;s son, drawing a deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
breath. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep this handkerchief to remember
him by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it marked in any way?&#8221; questioned our
hero. &#8220;Perhaps it has his name or initials on
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; returned Nat. &#8220;Let
us hurry up and get back to the school. If we
are late, old Haskers will be after us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on and run the boat as fast as you please,
Nat,&#8221; answered Dave. &#8220;But I want to look at
that handkerchief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather unwillingly, the money-lender&#8217;s son
passed the bandanna over. It was now growing
so dark that Dave could see but little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ll light a match,&#8221; suggested Gus, and
did so, and by the protected but flickering flare
our hero looked the handkerchief over. In one
corner there was a faint stamping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like &#8216;Rossmore Sanitarium&#8217; to me,&#8221;
said Dave, slowly. &#8220;Or it may be &#8216;Bossmore&#8217;
or &#8216;Crossmore.&#8217; The beginning is too faded to
be sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bossmore Sanitarium?&#8221; queried Nat, and
then he became silent and thoughtful. A little
later he asked for the bandanna and placed it in
his pocket.</p>
<p>The run in the motor-boat to the school dock
did not take long. As soon as Nat&#8217;s craft was
properly housed, Dave and Gus assisted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
money-lender&#8217;s son up the walk and across the
campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ve got to report the loss of the
rowboat,&#8221; said Gus, ruefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t your fault, Gus,&#8221; answered Dave.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you to Doctor Clay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go with my lame foot,&#8221; put in Nat,
and he hobbled up to his dormitory, eyed by several
curious students, who wanted to know how
he had gotten hurt.</p>
<p>The boys found the master of Oak Hall getting
ready for supper. He looked at them inquiringly
as they entered his study, in answer to
his invitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! well!&#8221; he exclaimed, after listening
to their story. &#8220;This is certainly odd! I trust
Poole was not seriously hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he was more scared than hurt,&#8221; answered
Dave. &#8220;The trap scratched his ankle,
that&#8217;s all. I am sure it is not sprained or broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the rowboat&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; put in Gus. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
mean&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not worry about that, Plum. It was not
your fault. I am glad the wild man did not harm
you. I think you got off well. After this you
must be careful about how you go out after this remarkable
creature.&#8221;</p>
<p>The master of the school then asked for more
particulars of the occurrence, and said he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
notify the town authorities about the loss of the
rowboat, and ask that a general hunt take place
for the wild man.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ought to be able to round him up sooner
or later,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>There was considerable excitement in the school
when it was learned that the wild man had been
heard of again. The boys looked for the strange
individual and so did the town authorities and
many farmers, but nothing came of the search.
Nat was called on to exhibit the bandanna handkerchief
and did so. Nobody could make out the
first part of the name on it, for the handkerchief
showed a small hole where the letters
should be.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is queer,&#8221; said Dave, to Roger and
Phil, when he heard of this. &#8220;That handkerchief
did not have a hole there when I looked at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Nat put the hole there,&#8221; returned the
senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would he do that?&#8221; questioned Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that nobody would know what the name
of the sanitarium really was. I believe with
Dave that Nat knows the man, or knows about
him, and is trying to keep something a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! Maybe you are right,&#8221; mused the
shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>Phil had perfected all his arrangements for
his spread at the hotel, and his guests for that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
occasion had been duly invited and all had accepted
the invitation. It had been arranged with
Mr. Dale that the boys should drive to the hotel
in the school carryall, and Horsehair was to have
his supper in town and, later on, bring them
home. No secret was made of the affair, for this
was not necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am only sorry for one thing,&#8221; said Phil to
Dave. &#8220;That is that I can&#8217;t have the whole
school there. But that would go beyond my
purse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll have enough, Phil, to insure a
good time,&#8221; answered our hero.</p>
<p>The night was clear, with numberless stars glittering
in the heavens, when the carryall drove
around to the Hall door and the boys piled in.
All were in the best of humor, and they left the
campus in a burst of song.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been saving up for this!&#8221; cried Ben.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t eaten a mouthful for two days!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that puts me in mind of a story,&#8221; cried
Shadow. &#8220;Once a poor street-boy was invited
to a Sunday-school picnic. The ladies fed him
all he could hold and then some. At last, when
he couldn&#8217;t eat another mouthful, and saw some
cake and pie and ice-cream going to waste, what
do you suppose he said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up, Shadow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;Say, missus, please save it fer me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
won&#8217;t yer? I won&#8217;t eat fer a week, honest, an&#8217;
then I&#8217;ll come an&#8217; finish it all up fer yer!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for the street-boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Phil, you won&#8217;t have to save anything
for me! I&#8217;ll eat my share right now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in training for this feed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shove the horses along, Horsehair; we don&#8217;t
want the soup to get cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a-shovin&#8217; &#8217;em along,&#8221; answered the carryall
driver. &#8220;We&#8217;ll git there in plenty o&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Phil, as far as I am concerned, you can
have this affair pulled off once a month,&#8221; remarked
Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it once a week,&#8221; piped in Chip Macklin.
And then Luke Watson commenced to sing a
popular negro ditty and all joined lustily in the
chorus.</p>
<p>On and on rattled the carryall until the lights
of Oakdale shone in the distance. The boys
continued to sing, while one or two blew freely on
the tin horns they carried. Here and there somebody
would come rushing to a window, or door,
to learn what was doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s them Oak Hall boys!&#8221; cried one old
farmer. &#8220;My, but they do have high times!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So they do,&#8221; returned his wife. &#8220;But they
are good boys,&#8221; she added, for some of them
had once aided her in capturing a runaway bull.</p>
<p>With a grand flourish the carryall swept around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
the last corner and came to a halt in front of the
hotel. Phil had hoped to see some extra lights
lit and was somewhat disappointed to see only
the regular lantern burning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him to light up freely and he said he
would,&#8221; he whispered to Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he thought you meant the dining-room,
Phil.&#8221;</p>
<p>The students piled out of the carryall and
waited for Phil, as host, to lead the way into the
hotel. All marched up the steps and into the
broad hallway. There they were confronted by
the hotel proprietor, who came to meet them in
his shirtsleeves. He looked completely bewildered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are here for that supper, Mr.
Sparr!&#8221; cried Phil. &#8220;I hope you are all ready
for us!&#8221;</p>
<p>The hotel man looked at the boys in amazement.
His jaw dropped. Then he gasped out
the words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be jiggered!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>AT THE HOTEL</h3>
</div>
<p>At once Dave and all the other students who
had come to the hotel with Phil, expecting a fine
spread, saw that something was wrong. They
looked questioningly at the shipowner&#8217;s son and
at the hotel proprietor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded Phil,
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter?&#8221; repeated Jason Sparr. &#8220;That&#8217;s
just exactly what I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you are ready for us, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
went on Phil, with a sudden catch in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I be ready, when you called the
whole thing off?&#8221; growled the hotel man. &#8220;Fine
way to do, I must say,&#8221; he continued, with strong
anger in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Called the whole thing off?&#8221; repeated Phil.
&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you!&#8221; shouted Jason Sparr. &#8220;And after
we had everything in fine shape, too! Say, don&#8217;t
you think my stuff is too good to send to the Old
Ladies&#8217; Home?&#8221; he demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There must be some mistake here, Mr.
Sparr,&#8221; put in our hero. &#8220;Phil didn&#8217;t call this
spread off. We are here for it, as you can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he did call it off&mdash;this noon,&#8221; returned
the hotel proprietor. &#8220;And he wasn&#8217;t a bit nice
about it, either. When I asked him what I should
do with the extras I had ordered he told me
to do as I pleased&mdash;send &#8217;em to the Old Ladies&#8217;
Home, or throw &#8217;em away! He didn&#8217;t act a bit
nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you chump, you!&#8221; shouted Phil, growing
suddenly angry. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t send you any
word at all about calling it off. I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you call me a chump, you young rascal!&#8221;
shouted the hotel man, in equal heat. &#8220;I
got your message over the telephone&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never sent any,&#8221; interrupted Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be a trick,&#8221; cried Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who played it?&#8221; queried another student.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe this is the work of some of the Military
Academy fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like as not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did they learn that Phil was going
to give the spread?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe some of our own fellows did it&mdash;some
who didn&#8217;t get an invitation to attend,&#8221; suggested
Chip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would any one be so mean?&#8221; asked Buster.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them might be,&#8221; murmured Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t send you any word,&#8221; went on Phil,
in greater anger than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I got word, and so did Professor
Smuller. He was mad, too, because he lost another
job taking yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you make sure the word was sent
by Mr. Lawrence?&#8221; demanded Ben. &#8220;You
could have done that easily enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think that was necessary. This fellow
said&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I didn&#8217;t send word!&#8221; shouted Phil,
growing more angry every instant. &#8220;You might
have known it was a trick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, he might have known,&#8221; added
Ben. He lowered his voice. &#8220;Say, Phil, if he
doesn&#8217;t give us the supper make him give your
money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure he&#8217;s got to give me the money back,&#8221;
cried the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, you can&#8217;t bulldoze me!&#8221; cried the
hotel proprietor. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had trouble enough as it
is. I got ready for this spread and then you
called it off, and you were mighty sassy about it,
too. I&#8217;ve lost a lot of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wordy war followed, lasting the best part
of a half an hour. Through this it was learned
that the hotel man had prepared for the spread,
and so had the professor of music. Just after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
noon telephone messages had come in, calling the
whole affair off. Some hot words had passed over
the wire, and the hotel man was considerably
ruffled. The party talking to Jason Sparr had
said that when the spread did come off it would
be held elsewhere&mdash;intimating that a better place
than his hotel could be found.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all some trick, to get my business away
from me!&#8221; stormed the hotel man. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
stand for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t send the messages, and I either want
the spread or I want my money back,&#8221; declared
Phil, stubbornly. And then more words followed,
until it looked as if there might be a fight. Finally,
in a rage, Jason Sparr ordered the students
from his place.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll go, but you haven&#8217;t heard
the end of this!&#8221; cried Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll catch it, for treating us so meanly,&#8221;
added Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you threaten me, or I&#8217;ll have the law
on you!&#8221; roared Jason Sparr.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;ll call on the law myself,&#8221; answered
Phil, and then, unable to control himself,
he shook his fist at the hotel man. Then all the
boys filed out of the place, some bystanders looking
on in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of this!&#8221; cried Gus,
when outside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Phil, I wouldn&#8217;t say anything more just now&mdash;you
are too excited,&#8221; said Dave, catching his
chum by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but that fellow is as mean as&mdash;as dirt!&#8221;
answered the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t any right to keep Phil&#8217;s money,&#8221;
said one student.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the feast is called off, is it?&#8221; said Buster,
with something like a groan in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And somebody is going to have the laugh on
us!&#8221; added Shadow. &#8220;Say, this puts me in mind
of a story,&#8221; he added, brightening. &#8220;Once some
boys were going&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stow it, Shadow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no time for stories!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather go down to the cemetery and
weep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody is going to have the laugh on me,&#8221;
cried Phil. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get something somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221; cried Dave. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221;
he added. &#8220;Let us drive over to Rockville and
get something at the hotel there. I know the proprietor
and he&#8217;s a nice man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better telephone to him first and make sure,&#8221;
suggested Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; said Phil.</p>
<p>The carryall was brought around again and all
piled in and drove down to a drug store where
there was a telephone booth. Into the booth went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
Phil, to communicate with the hotel in Rockville.
He came out smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all fixed up and I guess we&#8217;ll have something
this time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But just wait; I&#8217;ll fix
that mean Jason Sparr, see if I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a drive to Rockville,&#8221; protested
Horsehair, when they told the driver what was
wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, it will do the horses good,&#8221;
cried Roger. &#8220;They are getting too fat standing
still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Phil,&#8221; whispered Dave. &#8220;If you
haven&#8217;t got money enough along, I can let you
have some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; was the whispered return. &#8220;I was
going to speak of that, as soon as I got a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The affair at the Oakdale hotel had put something
of a damper on the crowd, and all the talk
was of how Jason Sparr had acted and who had
been mean enough to play such a trick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it was Nat Poole,&#8221; said Chip.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221; asked Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he is mean enough for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Nat did this I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll mash him!&#8221; cried
Phil, with energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you find out?&#8221; asked Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try&mdash;but most likely the fellow who did it
took care to cover up his tracks. Sparr didn&#8217;t
know where the messages came from.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>On and on rolled the carryall, until the lights
of Rockville appeared in the distance. By this
time all of the students were decidedly hungry.
They rolled up to the little hotel and those with
horns gave a couple of shrill blasts.</p>
<p>This time there was a warm welcome by the
host. He came out, bowing and smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the best I could for you, on such short
notice,&#8221; he said, as they entered. &#8220;Next time, if
you&#8217;ll only give me a little more time&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, let&#8217;s have what you&#8217;ve got,&#8221;
cried Buster. He was hungry enough to eat anything.</p>
<p>They were ushered into what was usually the
private dining-room of the little hostelry. The
table had been spread out and was tastefully
decorated with paper chrysanthemums, made by
the hotel man&#8217;s daughter. A parlor-lamp and
several others shed light on the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks good!&#8221; murmured Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you see what we get to eat,&#8221; answered
Sam. &#8220;It may be slim&mdash;on such short
notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he was agreeably mistaken, the spread was
all that could be desired. There were oysters on
the half-shell, tomato soup, fried chicken, mashed
potatoes, lettuce salad, olives, and also coffee, pie,
and various cookies. It was served in home style,
by the hotel man&#8217;s daughter and a hired girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, this is fine!&#8221; cried Buster, smacking his
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better, maybe, than if we had stayed at the
other place,&#8221; added Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only we haven&#8217;t got the music,&#8221; said Phil.
He was glad that matters had taken such a nice
turn, but still angry over what had gone before.</p>
<p>As they had already lost so much time, the boys
did not dare linger too long over the spread.
Horsehair was given something to eat in another
room, and then they set out on the return. Songs
were sung and jokes cracked, and Shadow was
permitted to tell half a dozen of his best stories.
Yet, with it all, the edge had been taken off the
celebration, and Phil knew this as well as anybody,
and was correspondingly chagrined.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make that man square up with me, see
if I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said to Dave, as they arrived at
the school. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to lose all that
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, be careful of what you do, Phil,&#8221;
warned our hero. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get into a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day the shipowner&#8217;s son sent out two
sharp letters, one to Jason Sparr and the other to
Professor Smuller. He stated that he was not
responsible for the trip-up that had taken place,
and demanded his money be returned to him,
otherwise he would put the matter in the hands of
the law.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>To these letters came speedy replies. The
musical professor said he was sorry a mistake had
been made, and he returned the amount paid to
him, and he further stated that if he could discover
who had played the trick he would make
that party settle up.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s decent of him,&#8221; said Phil. &#8220;I am
going to send him back five dollars for his trouble.&#8221;
And this he did, much to Professor Smuller&#8217;s
satisfaction.</p>
<p>The letter from Jason Sparr was entirely different.
He berated Phil for the stand taken,
and stated that he would pay back nothing. He
added that he had learned how the crowd had
gone to Rockville to dine, and said he was satisfied
that it was all a trick to get patronage away
from his hotel. He added that he had had trouble
enough with people from Oak Hall school
and he wanted no more of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to sue him,&#8221; growled Phil,
on showing the letter to Dave and Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d bother,&#8221; answered Dave.
&#8220;Put it down to Experience, and let it go at
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you sued him it would cost as much as
you&#8217;d get, and more,&#8221; added the senator&#8217;s
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! I don&#8217;t feel like swallowing it,&#8221;
growled Phil. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get it out of him somehow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He must have lost something&mdash;if he got
ready for the spread,&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think he lost much. He&#8217;s a close
one&mdash;to my way of thinking,&#8221; responded the shipowner&#8217;s
son.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE BLOWING UP OF THE BRIDGE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Say, this is something fierce, Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you, Roger. I don&#8217;t see how we
are going to do such a long lesson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Haskers is getting worse and worse,&#8221;
growled Phil. &#8220;I think we ought to report it
to Doctor Clay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I think,&#8221; came from Ben. &#8220;He
keeps piling it on harder and harder. I think
he is trying to break us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Break us?&#8221; queried our hero, looking up
from his book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, make us miss entirely, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should he want us to do that?&#8221; asked
Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we wouldn&#8217;t be able to graduate this
coming June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would he be mean enough to do that?&#8221;
asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he would be mean enough for anything,&#8221;
responded Phil. &#8220;Oh, I am not going
to stand it!&#8221; he cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>The boys had just come upstairs, after an extra
hard session in their Latin class. All were
aroused over the treatment received at the hands
of Job Haskers. He had been harsh and dictatorial
to the last degree, and several times it
had looked as if there might be an outbreak.</p>
<p>The next day the outbreak came. Phil sprang
up in class and denounced the unreasonable
teacher, and Ben followed. Then Dave and
Roger took a hand, and so did Buster and several
others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down! Sit down!&#8221; cried Job Haskers,
growing white in the face. &#8220;Sit down, and keep
quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t keep quiet,&#8221; answered the shipowner&#8217;s
son. &#8220;You are treating us unfairly,
Mr. Haskers, and I won&#8217;t stand for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither will I,&#8221; added Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, I tell you!&#8221; stormed the instructor.</p>
<p>But none of the students obeyed him, and in a
minute more the room was in an uproar. One of
the under-teachers heard it, and quickly sent for
Doctor Clay.</p>
<p>As the master of Oak Hall strode into the
classroom there was a pause. He mounted the
platform and put up his hand, and soon all became
quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young gentlemen, be seated,&#8221; he said, in his
strict but kindly fashion, and instantly every student
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
sat down. Then he turned to the teacher.
&#8220;Mr. Haskers, what is the trouble?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is that certain students will not
learn their lessons,&#8221; answered Job Haskers,
sourly. &#8220;I had to take them to task for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are those students?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawrence, Basswood, Porter, Morr,
Beggs&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do for the present. Lawrence,
stand up,&#8221; ordered Doctor Clay.</p>
<p>Phil did as requested, and the eyes of the entire
class were fastened on the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Lawrence, what have you to say for
yourself?&#8221; went on the doctor.</p>
<p>In a plain, straightforward manner, Phil told
his side of the story. Several times Job Haskers
wanted to interrupt him, but Doctor Clay would
not permit this. Then Ben was questioned, and
after that the master of the school turned to Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your complaint the same, Porter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yours, Morr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you to say, Beggs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same. The lessons lately have been altogether
too hard&mdash;we simply can&#8217;t get through
them. We never had such long lessons before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given them only the regular lessons,&#8221;
put in Job Haskers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! Let us go over them and see what
can be done,&#8221; responded the doctor. &#8220;If the
students are willing to work we do not want to
overburden them, Mr. Haskers.&#8221;</p>
<p>A discussion lasting over a quarter of an hour
followed, and in the end the lessons were cut
down, much to the satisfaction of the whole class,
who felt like cheering the head of the school.
The only person who was not satisfied was Job
Haskers. He was invited to go out with the doctor
to his private office, and came back some time
later, looking anything but happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager he got a calling down!&#8221; whispered
Phil to Dave. &#8220;I hope he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right about the &#8220;calling down,&#8221; as he
expressed it. The master of Oak Hall had
spoken very plainly to the instructor, and given
Job Haskers to understand that he must get along
better with the boys in the future, and treat them
with more consideration, or he would be asked to
resign from the staff of the school.</p>
<p>Several days slipped by and during that time
Dave paid close attention to his lessons. He had
also a theme to write on &#8220;The Future of Our
Country,&#8221; and he devoted considerable time to
this, hoping it would receive at least honorable
mention, even if it did not win the prize offered
for the best production.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on down to town!&#8221; cried Roger, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
afternoon, as he rushed in, &#8220;Big excitement on!
Going to blow the railroad up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blow the railroad up?&#8221; queried our hero.
&#8220;What sort of a joke is this, Roger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No joke, at all. You know the old stone
bridge over the creek?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the railroad wants to get rid of it and
do it quickly, so they can build another, so the
contractors are going to blow the old bridge up
with dynamite at half-past four o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221; burst out Phil. &#8220;It will be a
great sight&mdash;to see that old bridge go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221; cried Ben.</p>
<p>All the boys were enthusiastic, and in the end
fully fifty students got permission to go down to
Oakdale to see the old stone bridge destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of you must go very close,&#8221; warned
Doctor Clay, &#8220;for dynamite is powerful stuff&mdash;eight
times more powerful than gunpowder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep away, don&#8217;t fear about that,&#8221; answered
several.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dynamite isn&#8217;t to be fooled with,&#8221; added
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that puts me in mind of a story!&#8221; cried
Shadow. &#8220;A Dutch laborer working on the railroad
was much annoyed by the other laborers
coming along and knocking his stiff old derby hat
over his eyes. At last he got good and mad and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
when he saw a chance, he stole a stick of dynamite
from the shanty where it was kept. He stuck
the dynamite in his hat and then went around to
the other laborers. &#8216;Now, chust hit dot hat vonce
again of you dare!&#8217; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And nobody dared,&#8221; added Roger, as a general
laugh went up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I once saw a fellow take a stick of dynamite
and burn it like a torch,&#8221; remarked Ben. &#8220;It
gave me a cold chill to see him do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it didn&#8217;t explode?&#8221; queried Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But I heard afterwards that if he had
struck it ever so lightly, it might have blown us
all as high as a kite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is great stuff,&#8221; remarked Phil.
&#8220;Say,&#8221; he went on suddenly, &#8220;I wish they were
going to blow up old Sparr&#8217;s hotel instead of the
bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; added Ben. &#8220;He&#8217;s about as mean
as they make &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That man ought certainly to have something
done to him,&#8221; was Roger&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he won&#8217;t make a success of his hotel
if he treats everybody as he treated Phil,&#8221; said
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t deserve any success,&#8221; growled the
shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>When the students arrived in the vicinity of
the old bridge they found a large crowd assembled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
including many acquaintances from Rockville
Military Academy, and people from the
town. Red flags had been placed around, and nobody
was allowed to get very close to the old
structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is where they have the dynamite
stored,&#8221; said Phil, pointing to a shanty not far
away. &#8220;See the sign?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good spot to steer clear of,&#8221; returned
Dave, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not afraid of the stuff,&#8221; answered
the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>In the crowd of men and boys the students became
more or less separated. There was a great
thrill when the word was passed that everything
was in readiness for the blowing up of the old
bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going!&#8221; cried Roger to Dave.</p>
<p>Boom! came the dull, heavy roar, and the
boys saw the stones of the old bridge flying upward
in all directions. The ground shook all
around them, and the water from the creek was
splashed on high. A great cloud of smoke and
dust filled the air. Then came silence, followed
by a wild cheering from the younger element.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly a great sight,&#8221; was Dave&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad it didn&#8217;t last longer,&#8221; sighed Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t quite as big as I thought it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
be,&#8221; said Luke. &#8220;I thought some of the stones
would fly about a mile high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough for a free exhibition,&#8221; put in
Gus. &#8220;Beats fireworks all hollow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys walked down to the ruins of the old
bridge and hung around for the best part of a
half an hour. Then, in groups of five or six, they
walked to town, to look around there before returning
to Oak Hall. Dave and his chums passed
Jason Sparr&#8217;s hotel. He was on the veranda and
scowled at them, and Phil and some of the others
scowled in return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you done anything about that Sparr
matter yet, Phil?&#8221; asked one of the lads.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I will soon, you wait and see,&#8221; was
the growled-out reply.</p>
<p>On the main street of the town some of the
boys separated, to do a little shopping, and then
some walked to the school, while others got in
the carryall that happened to be at hand. As a
consequence some of the students did not get back
to Oak Hall until some time after the supper
hour.</p>
<p>Dave was alone when he entered the dining-hall
and he was surprised to see that neither Phil
nor Roger was present. Ben was also absent and
likewise Shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t some of them come in with you?&#8221; he
asked of Buster.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gus and Luke did,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know where the others are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meal was almost at an end when Phil,
Ben, and Roger made their appearance. They
had but little to say, but Dave could see that
something was wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had another wrangle with Jason Sparr,&#8221; explained
Phil, after the meal. &#8220;He followed me
to one of the stores, and I told him just what I
thought of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he threatened to have Phil arrested for
defamation of character,&#8221; added Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t dare to do it,&#8221; declared the
shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better let him alone,&#8221; advised Dave.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll gain nothing by keeping in hot water
over it, Phil.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night all of the boys had to study hard,
and consequently they retired to their dormitories
early. The only exception was Polly Vane,
who had to go to Oakdale to meet a relative who
would stop off but who was going away again on
the midnight train.</p>
<p>The boys studied until ten o&#8217;clock and then retired.
Dave was completely tired out and his
head had hardly touched the pillow when he was
sound asleep.</p>
<p>He was awakened about two hours later by
the sounds of excited talking. He opened his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
eyes to behold Polly Vane standing in the dormitory
fully dressed, while Phil was sitting on the
edge of the bed, and Ben and Roger and some
others were just rousing up.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Dave asked, sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;A whole lot, if what Polly says is true,&#8221; answered
the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is true, upon my word!&#8221; cried the girlish
student. &#8220;I heard the explosion myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What explosion?&#8221; asked several.</p>
<p>&#8220;An explosion in Oakdale, to-night,&#8221; answered
Polly. &#8220;Somebody tried to dynamite Jason
Sparr&#8217;s hotel!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A SERIOUS ACCUSATION</h3>
</div>
<p>Instantly there was great excitement in the
dormitory, and all of the students crowded
around Polly, to learn what he might have to
say.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was this way, don&#8217;t you know,&#8221; said the
scholarly youth. &#8220;I went to Oakdale to see my
uncle, who stopped off on his trip from Portland
to St. Louis. He wanted to ask me about
some family matters, and he didn&#8217;t have time
to come to the Hall. I went down in the
buggy&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind that, Polly, tell about the
explosion,&#8221; interrupted Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had just seen my uncle to the midnight
train and was getting into the buggy to come
back when I heard a low boom! coming from
the direction of Sparr&#8217;s hotel. The station-master
and I were the only people around, and
I asked him what the noise meant, but he said he
didn&#8217;t know. Then he jumped into the buggy
with me to find out. We drove to the hotel, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
there was excitement enough, I can tell you. The
girls and women folks were screaming wildly
and Mr. Sparr and some men were running
around, not knowing what to do. Soon a crowd
began to collect, and then we found out that a
wing of the building&mdash;where the dining-room is&mdash;had
been blown up. Some men from the railroad
said it had been done by dynamite&mdash;the kind
used for blowing up that old bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was anybody hurt?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody but an old man who was sleeping in
the house next to the addition. He got so scared
he jumped from an upper window and sprained
his ankle. Oh, that dining-room is a sight, I can
tell you! One end is completely gone&mdash;the wall
away from the main house&mdash;and all the tables
and chairs and ornaments smashed! And the roof
is full of holes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How was it done?&#8221; questioned Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dynamite was placed at the side of the
dining-room foundation, according to the railroad
men, and it was set off by some sort of clockwork,&#8221;
answered Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who did it?&#8221; asked Shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t know, yet. But Sparr suspects
Phil. That is why I woke him up as soon as I
came in,&#8221; continued the girlish student.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suspects me!&#8221; exclaimed the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He says you are the only one who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
would do such a thing&mdash;you and the crowd who
have been backing you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he means me, too,&#8221; murmured Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does, and all the others in the crowd, too.
He thinks it&#8217;s a plot to get square because he
wouldn&#8217;t give Phil his dinner money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had nothing to do with it,&#8221; declared Phil,
stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; added Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am sure I wasn&#8217;t in it,&#8221; said Dave.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t dream of such a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor did I,&#8221; added Roger and some others.</p>
<p>The news soon spread through several dormitories,
and the boys discussed the startling happening
in whispers. Phil was greatly disturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it, but I know he&#8217;ll try to fasten
it on me,&#8221; he told Dave. He did not add that
he had written to his father about the affair of
the feast and his parent had sent a warning letter
back, ordering his son to have nothing more to
do with Jason Sparr.</p>
<p>The next morning the news was all over the
school. Nat Poole heard of it, and he and some
of his cronies declared it as their opinion that
Phil and some others were to blame. This
brought on a fistic encounter between Ben and
the money-lender&#8217;s son, and the latter got a black
eye in consequence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You sha&#8217;n&#8217;t say I did it&mdash;or had anything
to do with it,&#8221; said Ben, when Nat backed away,
having had enough of the battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! just wait till the law has its say!&#8221;
retorted Nat. &#8220;Then maybe you&#8217;ll get what is
coming to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the boys wanted to go to town&mdash;to see
the damaged hotel&mdash;but Doctor Clay would not
permit this. In the meantime the wreckage was
being cleared away, and the authorities and Jason
Sparr were doing their best to locate the author
or authors of the crime.</p>
<p>Then came a great surprise, in the shape of a
letter delivered in a mysterious way to the hotel-keeper.
He was seated in the hotel office in the
evening, talking to one of the town constables,
when a missive was hurled at him through an
open window. He dodged at first, fearing more
dynamite, but when he saw it was only a letter, he
picked it up and turned it over. It was addressed
to him and marked &#8220;Private and Personal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder what this is?&#8221; he mused, and walked
over to the light to read the letter. It was written
on a single sheet of paper, in lead pencil, and
evidently in a disguised hand. It contained but
a few lines, as follows:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;If you want to catch the fellows who blew up
your hotel have these boys of Oak Hall school arrested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
at once, Philip Lawrence, Benj. Basswood,
David Porter, Roger Morr, and Joseph Beggs.
They were together when it was done, and one or
more of them surely did it.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; text-align:right'>&#8220;One Who Knows.&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>The hotel-keeper read this letter several times
and then stuffed it into his pocket. Then he went
into the next room and drew from a drawer several
things wrapped up in a newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going down to see the squire,&#8221; he said,
to the constable. &#8220;You can come along, if you
want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was in the letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The names of the rascals who blew up my
hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! You don&#8217;t mean it, Jason!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who sent the letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a secret. But come on, we&#8217;ll talk it
over with Squire Thompson. Ain&#8217;t no time to
waste.&#8221; And then the hotel man went off to interview
the leading legal light of the town.</p>
<p>The conference at the squire&#8217;s office lasted the
best part of two hours. At this Jason Sparr produced
the contents of the package, several things
picked up near the hotel at the time of the explosion&mdash;a
tan glove, somewhat worn, two iron
rings, an empty paper box marked, &#8220;L.&#8221; in one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
corner, a whip handle, and a clock-like contrivance
which had been used to set off the dynamite. He
told of his trouble with Phil and his chums, of the
threats made, and produced the letter received
so mysteriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks kind of plain to me, Squire,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t for me to say,&#8221; replied the squire, cautiously.
&#8220;But if you want to swear out warrants
for those boys&#8217; arrest&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I justified?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you are,&#8221; put in the constable, who happened
to be the squire&#8217;s brother-in-law. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t waste no time on it.&#8221; He thought he
saw in this a job for himself, with some fat
fees.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have them arrested, you&#8217;ve got to
prove your case,&#8221; said Squire Thompson, slowly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a serious business, Sparr.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this letter says they are guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lock &#8217;em up and make &#8217;em confess!&#8221; broke
in the constable. &#8220;Give &#8217;em the third degree!&#8221;
he added. He had read something of how city
criminals were occasionally treated and he wished
to air his knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; cried Jason Spar. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show
&#8217;em they can&#8217;t insult me and take away my trade
and then try to blow up my hotel! I&#8217;ll have &#8217;em
all locked up! Then we can examine &#8217;em one by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
one, and get &#8217;em tangled up and make &#8217;em confess.&#8221;</p>
<p>After much trouble, the warrants for the arrest
of Phil, Ben, Dave, Roger, and Buster were made
out. The constable wanted to serve them at
once, but it was decided at the last moment to
wait until the next morning, to see if any new
evidence regarding the crime might be forthcoming.</p>
<p>The constable went home, sworn to secrecy,
but he had to tell his wife and her sister of the
affair, and the news got to the ears of a man who
boarded with them. This fellow, who was named
Andy Prime, chanced to know Dave quite well,
our hero having once done him a favor. Early
in the morning Prime drove past the school, and
seeing Dave on the campus, hailed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over here, I want to tell you something,
Porter,&#8221; said Prime, mysteriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked Dave, good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride a bit with me, will you? I don&#8217;t want
nobody to hear us,&#8221; went on the man, lowering
his voice.</p>
<p>Wondering what was coming, Dave got up on
the seat of the man&#8217;s wagon and they drove to
the far end of the Oak Hall grounds. There
Andy Prime told of all he had learned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say I told ye!&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
might git me in trouble. But you did me a good
turn onct an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t forgot it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Prime, I won&#8217;t tell who told me,&#8221;
answered Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet old skinflint o&#8217; a Sparr deserved to have
his buildin&#8217; blown up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. But we didn&#8217;t do it, I can assure
you of that. If Mr. Sparr has us arrested, he&#8217;ll
get in hot water,&#8221; answered our hero; and then
he got out of the wagon and Andy Prime
drove on.</p>
<p>Dave at once carried the news to those immediately
concerned. All were very indignant, and
some were scared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I won&#8217;t stand for being arrested!&#8221; cried
Phil, in horror. &#8220;It&#8217;s too much of a disgrace!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My folks would never get over it,&#8221; added
Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would just about kill my mother, if I was
locked up,&#8221; came from Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll stand it if I have to,&#8221; said Roger.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll make that fellow suffer for it later!&#8221;
he added, bitterly.</p>
<p>All thoughts of going to school that morning
were abandoned by the five boys. They talked the
situation over, and determined to go down the
road and await the arrival of the constable, Andy
Prime having said that Hickson would come by
ten o&#8217;clock.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is awful!&#8221; gasped Phil, shaking his
head dolefully. &#8220;Say, Dave, I can&#8217;t stand it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until we hear what the constable has to
say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t say anything&mdash;he&#8217;ll just drag us
to the Oakdale lockup!&#8221; put in Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what my dad will say to that, when
he hears of it?&#8221; murmured Roger. &#8220;The newspapers
are bound to make a spread of it. &#8216;Son of
a U. S. Senator Jailed for Blowing Up a Hotel!&#8217;
or something like that. Oh, it makes me sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Plainly the majority of the students were very
nervous. The only one who kept calm was Dave,
and even he was much disturbed. All walked
along the road, keeping a sharp eye out for the
appearance of Paul Hickson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here he comes!&#8221; cried Phil, as a covered
wagon came along the road, driven by the keeper
of the Oakdale jail. On the front seat beside the
driver were the constable and Jason Sparr.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, you boys!&#8221; shouted the constable, as the
wagon came closer. &#8220;I want to see you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; demanded Dave, stepping
to the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want you, for one!&#8221; cried the hotel-keeper.
&#8220;Be careful, Hickson, that none of &#8217;em
get away!&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know one from tudder,&#8221; said the constable,
doubtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is just the bunch we are after, unless I
am mistaken,&#8221; went on the hotel man. &#8220;That is
Lawrence there, and Basswood, and this is Porter,
and I think that is Morr,&#8221; and he pointed to
the various students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough. Boys, in the name of the law,
I call on you to halt,&#8221; declared the constable,
pompously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sparr, what does this mean?&#8221; demanded
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that I am going to have the whole
bunch of you arrested!&#8221; shouted the hotel man,
harshly. &#8220;You blew up my hotel, and I can
prove it! I&#8217;ve got the evidence against every
one of you! I am going to have you arrested
right now and sent to prison!&#8221; And he shook his
fist at the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;The evidence against us?&#8221; faltered Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, the plain, clear evidence,&#8221; went on
the hotel-keeper, dramatically. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got you
just where I want you. I am going to send every
one of you to prison for five or ten years!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE MEETING ON THE ROAD</h3>
</div>
<p>There was an intense silence, following the
announcement of Jason Sparr that he intended to
send Dave and his chums to prison for attempting
to blow up the hotel. In the meantime the hotel
man and the constable got down from the seat of
the covered wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the warrants fer the arrest, boys,&#8221;
said Constable Hickson, somewhat importantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sparr, I&#8217;d like a word with you,&#8221; said
Dave, as calmly as he could speak under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no more to say than I&#8217;ve said,&#8221;
returned Jason Sparr, stubbornly. &#8220;You done
it, and I can prove it! The constable is going
to do his duty and arrest you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, I&mdash;I won&#8217;t stand for it!&#8221; whispered
Phil, hoarsely. &#8220;It&#8217;s terrible! I&mdash;I can&#8217;t stand
it!&#8221; And he began to back away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, there! stop!&#8221; yelled the hotel man.
&#8220;Stop him, Hickson! Don&#8217;t let him get away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sha&#8217;n&#8217;t arrest me for nothing!&#8221; cried the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
shipowner&#8217;s son, and like a flash he turned around
and started off on a run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back here, Phil!&#8221; called out Dave.
&#8220;Come back! You are making a mistake by running
away!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Phil did not hear, nor did Ben and Buster,
who had also taken to their heels. Roger ran a
few steps, then halted, and came back to our hero&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Dave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s best
to face the music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil, Ben, and Buster had turned towards Oak
Hall. Phil was in the lead, but the others soon
caught up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&mdash;what are you go&mdash;going to d&mdash;do?&#8221;
panted Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let them arrest me!&#8221; answered
Phil. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it, and I&#8217;m not going
to jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hide until we can get our folks to
help us,&#8221; suggested Buster. The thought of going
to a lockup filled him with dread.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to notify my folks, too,&#8221; said
Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is, I don&#8217;t know where my folks
are just now,&#8221; came from the shipowner&#8217;s son.
&#8220;My father went on a trip on one of his vessels
and mother is visiting relatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys had kept on running on the road.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
But now, as they saw the constable after them,
they turned and dashed into a side-path leading
to the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;A motor-boat!&#8221; cried Ben, a few seconds
later.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Kingsley boat,&#8221; added Buster. &#8220;I
know Tom will let us use it&mdash;he said I could do
it once. Let us go across in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All leaped on board, and Ben started up the
engine while Buster took the wheel. There came
a put! put! as the fly-wheel was turned over, and
the little craft, which belonged to a boy living
on the river-bank, headed out into the Leming
River.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while Constable Hickson was
running after the fugitives, Jason Sparr and the
driver of the covered wagon confronted Dave and
Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you try to run!&#8221; bawled the hotel-keeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m armed,&#8221; added the keeper of the town
lockup, suggestively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to run, Mr. Sparr,&#8221; answered
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we run, since we have done nothing
wrong?&#8221; added the senator&#8217;s son. He tried
to follow Dave&#8217;s example and remain calm, but
he was tremendously disturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did those three fellows do it alone?&#8221; queried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the hotel man, eagerly. &#8220;If they did, you had
better confess to it, and clear yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of us are guilty,&#8221; answered Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not. Since we didn&#8217;t do it, Mr. Sparr,
I don&#8217;t see how you can prove that we did,&mdash;unless
you have manufactured some evidence
against us,&#8221; went on our hero, pointedly, a new
idea coming into his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t manufactured no evidence!&#8221; bawled
Jason Sparr. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t that young rascal of a
Lawrence say he&#8217;d get square with me, and didn&#8217;t
all of you say the same? Wasn&#8217;t you down to the
blowing up of the bridge, right where they had
all that dynamite stored? Wasn&#8217;t some of the
dynamite sticks stolen? Didn&#8217;t you fellows come
right by the hotel afterwards? Wasn&#8217;t the
blowing up done by clockwork, made to go
off hours after it was set? You can&#8217;t tell
me! You are guilty. Besides, I got other evidence&mdash;I
got a letter,&#8221; added the hotel-keeper,
shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A letter? About us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason Sparr nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saying we were guilty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wrote it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that. You&#8217;re guilty, and you
know it. Just wait till Hickson comes back with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
them others and I&#8217;ll show you a thing or two,&#8221;
continued the hotel man, harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sparr, I said I wanted to talk to you,
and I do want to,&#8221; said Dave, after a pause.
&#8220;You will find it to your advantage to listen
to me. You have got this whole thing settled in
your own mind, but you are dead wrong. You
intend to have us locked up for something we
didn&#8217;t do. To have us locked up will blacken our
characters and blacken the reputation of Oak
Hall. My folks are respectable people, and so
are the folks of the other boys. Do you think
they will stand for this sort of thing? And do you
think Doctor Clay will stand for it? If you do,
you are greatly mistaken. If you have us arrested
on this charge, which is absolutely false, I&#8217;ll get
my folks to sue you for false imprisonment and
defamation of character, and I know the other
fellows will do the same. And you can rest assured
that the charges against you will be pushed
to the limits of the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this plain talk Jason Sparr&#8217;s jaw dropped.
Several times he was on the point of interrupting,
but thought better of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now&mdash;er&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; he stammered when
Dave had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father is a United States senator,&#8221; said
Roger. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose he will let a matter
like this pass unnoticed? If you do anything to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
besmirch our family name, you&#8217;ll take the consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father is a United States senator?&#8221; faltered
Jason Sparr.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is, and Dave&#8217;s father is a rich man, and
so is Phil Lawrence&#8217;s father. Of course, our
money has nothing to do with it, excepting that it
will enable us to stand up for our rights in the
courts, and get able lawyers to defend us. We
are innocent of all wrongdoing. If anybody is
in the wrong it is you, for you cheated Phil Lawrence
out of the money he advanced to you for
that spread we were to have at your hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheated him!&#8221; cried the hotel-keeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what it amounted to, for you took his
money and gave him nothing in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He called the spread off&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not, and we can prove it,&#8221; said Dave,
following up what he thought looked like an advantage.
&#8220;Why, if he wanted to do it, Phil could
have you locked up for swindling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, me? Locked up?&#8221; cried the hotel
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Why not? It&#8217;s as reasonable as
your charge against us&mdash;more reasonable, in fact,
for you kept his money and gave him nothing in
return,&#8221; went on our hero, warmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now what do you know about that?&#8221;
grumbled Jason Sparr, turning to the driver of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
the covered wagon. But the lockup man merely
shrugged his shoulders. Privately he was of the
opinion that the boys were not such rascals as had
been pictured.</p>
<p>&#8220;If those fellows wasn&#8217;t guilty, why did they
run away?&#8221; continued Jason Sparr, after an awkward
pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you scared them,&#8221; responded Roger.
&#8220;I would have run away myself if it hadn&#8217;t been
for Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221;</p>
<p>All looked along the road. Constable Hickson
had disappeared, having followed the runaways
down to the river. Presently he came back,
out of breath from his exertions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get &#8217;em?&#8221; queried the hotel-keeper,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they got away in a motor-boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A motor-boat!&#8221; repeated Dave and Roger,
and looked at each other in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, went up the river out of sight,&#8221; said
Paul Hickson. &#8220;Too bad! But we&#8217;ve got two of
&#8217;em, anyway,&#8221; he added, looking at our hero and
the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted Lawrence more than I did the
others,&#8221; grumbled Jason Sparr. He was doing
some deep thinking and his face showed that he
was much disturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sparr, just remember what I said,&#8221; remarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Dave, pointedly. &#8220;If you go ahead, take
my word for it, it will cost you dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Hickson, we&#8217;ll drop this matter for
the present,&#8221; said the hotel-keeper, in a low
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop it?&#8221; ejaculated the constable. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
you goin&#8217; to have these two took up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just now. I&mdash;er&mdash;I want to get more
evidence first, if I can. We can get them any
time we want them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is going to pay me for my trouble?
I&#8217;ve got them warrants to serve right in my
pocket, and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix that up with you,&#8221; answered the hotel
man, in a whisper. &#8220;Come on. We can come
back later.&#8221; And then the hotel man said something
to the driver of the wagon. The latter
merely nodded and got back to his seat. Jason
Sparr climbed up beside him, and the constable
slowly followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; went on the constable;
but Jason Sparr merely pinched his arm,
and he stopped short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just remember, this ain&#8217;t settled yet!&#8221; cried
the hotel-keeper, to Dave and Roger. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to look into it a bit deeper before I make a move,
that&#8217;s all. I know some of you done it, and
I&#8217;ll have you in prison for it yet, see if I don&#8217;t!&#8221;
And he shook his head grimly; and then the covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
wagon was turned around, and the three
men drove off in the direction of Oakdale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dave, do you think they&#8217;ll come back?&#8221;
cried Roger, when the men were out of hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no telling what they will do, Roger.
But you can make up your mind to one thing&mdash;Sparr
won&#8217;t come back until he has more evidence
than he has at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can he get evidence? Surely you
don&#8217;t think Phil and the others guilty, even if they
did run away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think Phil and the others are as innocent
as we are. But I can&#8217;t understand some
things. Somebody used that dynamite and somebody
wrote a letter to Sparr about us. The question
is, Who was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it be Nat Poole?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Nat would be bad enough to
try to blow up a hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly was an awful thing to do.&#8221;
Roger drew a long breath. &#8220;What shall we do
now, go back to school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well. If we don&#8217;t, old Haskers
will be after us again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think Phil and the others will come
back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? As soon as they have time to
think it over they&#8217;ll realize it is best to face the
music,&#8221; answered Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>He and Roger returned to Oak Hall. They
had missed one class, but fortunately that was one
presided over by Mr. Dale, and he readily excused
them when they said they had had some
personal matters of importance to attend to, and
would explain later.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is bound to come out, sooner or later,&#8221;
said Dave to his chum. &#8220;So we might as well
take Doctor Clay and Mr. Dale into our confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right,&#8221; answered the senator&#8217;s
son. Nevertheless, he heaved a deep sigh,
as he thought of what might be the outcome of
the trouble. What if, after all, Jason Sparr
should concoct some sort of evidence against them
and send them all to prison?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>LOOKING FOR THE RUNAWAYS</h3>
</div>
<p>When Dave and Roger went to the midday
meal in the dining-room they looked all over for
Phil, Ben, and Buster, but the three were not in
sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, they haven&#8217;t come back yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I see,&#8221; returned our hero, and he was
much disturbed. He ate sparingly, and the senator&#8217;s
son also had but little appetite for the
meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what&#8217;s become of those chaps?&#8221; questioned
Shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you later,&#8221; answered Dave. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
say anything now&mdash;and tell the others to keep
quiet, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>But such a happening could not be kept quiet,
and soon it was whispered around that Phil, Ben,
and Buster were missing. This presently got to
the ears of Andrew Dale, and the head assistant
teacher sought out Dave for an explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand you went out with Lawrence,
Basswood, and Beggs this morning, Porter,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
the teacher. &#8220;They are not yet back. Do you
know where they went?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They went off in a motor-boat, that is all I
know about that part of it, Mr. Dale. Roger
Morr and I would like to speak to you and Doctor
Clay in private. It is very important,&#8221; went on
our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Come at once to the office and I
will call the doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little later found the two youths in the office
with Doctor Clay and his head assistant. There,
as briefly as he could, Dave told his story, and
Roger corroborated what was said. The head of
the school was deeply interested and not a little
alarmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly serious,&#8221; he declared, with
a grave shake of his head. &#8220;It reflects not only
on you but on this school. I must look into this
at once.&#8221; And then he asked many questions, and
Andrew Dale did the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Running away makes it look bad for Lawrence,
Beggs, and Basswood,&#8221; remarked Mr.
Dale. &#8220;They should have stood their ground, as
Morr and Porter did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That hotel man and the constable probably
scared them so they did not know what they
were doing,&#8221; returned Doctor Clay. He turned
to the boys. &#8220;You have no idea where they
went?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, excepting that they went up the river
in the Kingsley motor-boat. They know Tom
Kingsley quite well and he lets them use the boat
once in a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you could find them, if I let you
off to do so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We could try, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you may go at once. Tell them it was
very foolish to run away, and urge them to come
back at once,&#8221; added Doctor Clay.</p>
<p>A little more conversation followed, and then
Dave and Roger left the office and started on
the search for the runaways.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to have a motor-boat ourselves,
to follow them up the river&mdash;that is, if they went
any distance,&#8221; said the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might try to borrow one, Roger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Nat Poole&#8217;s&mdash;he wouldn&#8217;t lend it to
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two students walked to the river and
looked up and down the stream. A rowboat and
a sailboat were in sight, but that was all.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is Jack Laplow in his sloop,&#8221; cried
Dave, mentioning a riverman they knew. &#8220;The
wind is blowing up the stream. Maybe he&#8217;ll take
us along.&#8221;</p>
<p>They hailed the riverman, who made a living
by doing all sorts of jobs on the stream. He did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
not have much to do just then and readily agreed,
for a small amount, to take them up the river
and bring them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to find some fellows who are in the
Kingsley motor-boat,&#8221; explained Dave. &#8220;Have
you seen anything of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>The riverman had not, but said he would help
to watch out for the lads. Dave and Roger
hopped aboard the sloop, and soon the little craft
was standing up the Leming River, with Jack
Laplow at the tiller.</p>
<p>It was a warm, clear day, and had the boys
not been distressed in mind, they would have
enjoyed the sail immensely. But as it was, they
were very sober, so much so in fact that the old
riverman at length remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong&mdash;somebody hurt, or are ye
going to a funeral?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No funeral,&#8221; answered Dave, with a forced
laugh. &#8220;But we are in a hurry to find those three
fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see no motor-boat yet,&#8221; answered
Jack Laplow.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing is certain: if it went up the river
it&#8217;s got to come down,&#8221; said Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may get out and send it back,&#8221; answered
our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Dave, surely you don&#8217;t think&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; But
Dave put up his hand for silence and nodded in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
the direction of the boatman; and the senator&#8217;s
son said no more.</p>
<p>A mile and a half were covered, and they were
just passing one of the many islands in the river,
when Jack Laplow gave a shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the motor-boat now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boat ahoy!&#8221; shouted Dave, and then, as they
drew closer, he saw that it was really the Kingsley
craft. He was chagrined to see that only a man
was on board, a fellow who was running the boat
very slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are those boys who were aboard?&#8221;
demanded our hero, as the motor-boat came
closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this your boat?&#8221; asked the man on board,
in return.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but my friends were on that boat.
Where are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Left the boat at Snog&#8217;s Point, and hired
me to bring her back. I don&#8217;t know much about
motor-boats, so I&#8217;m running kind o&#8217; slow,&#8221; explained
the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snog&#8217;s Point?&#8221; repeated Roger. &#8220;Where
were they going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, for I don&#8217;t know. They was
in a tremenjous hurry, I know that. It&#8217;s all right,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; went on the man, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it was all right,&#8221; answered Dave.
And then they allowed the man to go on his way.</p>

&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>There is the motor-boat now</span>!&#8221;&mdash;<i>Page 186</i>.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Want to go up to Snog&#8217;s Point?&#8221; asked the
man of the sloop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;and as quickly as you can get there,&#8221;
replied Dave.</p>
<p>As the wind was in the right direction, it did
not take long. The Point was a rocky cliff with
a stretch of sand at its base. Here the boys
jumped ashore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to wait for you?&#8221; asked the riverman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait for half an hour,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;Then,
if we are not back, you can go back;&#8221; and so it
was arranged.</p>
<p>In the sand our hero and Roger could plainly
see the marks of the motor-boat and many footprints.
They followed the footprints to a road
leading through a stretch of woods, and then
came out on a highway leading to Barrelton.</p>
<p>&#8220;The town is about half a mile from here.
Wonder if they went there?&#8221; mused Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we can learn something at the nearest
farmhouse,&#8221; suggested Dave.</p>
<p>They hurried on, and presently reached a farmhouse
set close to the road, with a barn on the
other side. At a grindstone a tall, thin boy was
sharpening a sickle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw them fellers,&#8221; he drawled, when
asked about the runaways. &#8220;They was walking
to town to beat the cars. I thought they must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
in one o&#8217; them cross-country races, or something
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried Dave to his chum. Then
he turned back suddenly. &#8220;Do you know anything
about the trains from Barrelton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t many trains from there,&#8221; answered the
youth at the grindstone.</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you know what there are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a train north jest about due now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A train south a leetle after four o&#8217;clock. An&#8217;
the freight goes through at seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry, Roger!&#8221; cried Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think they&#8217;d take a train, Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I hope not.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two boys set off on a run, taking it easy
at first, so as not to get winded. They passed
a number of farms and presently came in sight
of Barrelton, so called because of the barrel factory
located there. From a distance they had
heard the whistle of a locomotive, and knew that
the north-bound train had stopped at the station
and gone on.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the station!&#8221; cried Dave, pointing
up the railroad tracks. They continued to run
and did not stop until they gained the platform.
Here they met the ticket agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The train just went, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Dave,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
and as the agent nodded, he went on: &#8220;Did three
young fellows like ourselves get on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they did, I didn&#8217;t see &#8217;em,&#8221; answered the
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Roger, &#8220;maybe they didn&#8217;t take
the train, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somewhat out of breath, the two boys tramped
around Barrelton, looking for Phil and the others,
and asking about them. But nobody appeared to
have seen the runaways, and not a trace of them
was to be found anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we can do is to get something to eat and
take the other train for Oakdale,&#8221; said Roger,
after they had satisfied themselves that the runaways
were nowhere in that vicinity. The walking
around had made him hungry.</p>
<p>They procured some pie and milk at a little
stand near the station, and shortly after four
o&#8217;clock took the way train for Oakdale and walked
to the school. They went directly to the doctor&#8217;s
office. The master of Oak Hall listened patiently
to what they had to tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry you did not find them,&#8221; he said,
gravely. &#8220;It was very foolish of them to run
away, very. I trust they will come back of their
own accord soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you see Mr. Sparr about the matter?&#8221;
asked Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Porter. And I wish you and Morr to
go with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interview took place that evening, the boys
and the doctor driving down to the hotel after
supper. Jason Sparr treated the master of the
Hall politely but said very little.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I make my next move I&#8217;ll have a lawyer,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I know somebody tried to blow
up my hotel, and I think it was some of your boys&mdash;that
Lawrence boy especially. But I ain&#8217;t going
to have &#8217;em arrested until I can prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; answered Doctor Clay. &#8220;And
in the meantime, you had better keep quiet, or
you may have a suit for damages on hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the day following there was something of a
sensation. The weekly newspaper issued in a
nearby town came out with a thrilling account of
the dynamiting of the dining-room of the hotel.
In the account appeared the following:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;There is strong evidence pointing to the fact
that the outrageous deed was perpetrated by some
schoolboys who held a grudge against Mr. Sparr.
They are known to have been present at the blowing
up of the old stone bridge, and were seen near
the shanty where the sticks of dynamite were kept,
and one boy of the town says he saw a young man
coming from the shanty with something in his
hand. Mr. Sparr has the authorities at work and
is piling up his evidence, and the arrest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
rascally schoolboys may be hourly expected. It is
said that some of the boys have run away, but the
authorities have an idea where they can be located.
The town committee is thinking of offering
a reward for the capture and conviction of
the rascals. For the safety of our citizens, the
Weekly Globe-Leader hopes the evil-doers will
soon be apprehended.&#8221;</p>
<p>No names were mentioned in this account, but
everybody in Oakdale and vicinity knew that the
boys of Oak Hall were alluded to, and there was
much talk over what might be done. Doctor Clay
felt the disgrace keenly, and Dave and Roger were
equally affected.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to do, Dave?&#8221; asked
the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned our hero. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ve got to do something, that&#8217;s certain.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE WILD MAN AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Roger, I have an idea!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be mistaken, but I&#8217;ve been thinking
that perhaps that wild man did the blowing up
at the hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221; questioned the
senator&#8217;s son, putting down the book he had been
trying to study.</p>
<p>A day had passed after the events recorded
in the last chapter, and so far no word had come
in concerning Phil and the other runaways. Doctor
Clay had sent for a private detective to assist
in locating them and also to try, if possible, to
clear up the mystery concerning the hotel affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place, it would be just like
a crazy man to do such a thing, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the second place, I have heard that the
wild man was seen around when the bridge was
blown up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? Who saw him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Tyson, the farmer who lives near the
bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he try to capture the fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did, but in the excitement of the blowing
up the wild man slipped him. And that isn&#8217;t all.
Mr. Tyson saw him coming from the vicinity of
that shanty where the dynamite was kept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that is certainly interesting!&#8221; cried the
senator&#8217;s son. &#8220;When did you learn all this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than an hour ago. Mr. Tyson brought
some vegetables to the school and I had a talk
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he think the wild man blew up the
hotel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t connect the two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! What do you think of doing about
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know. I wish we could round up the
wild man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of folks wish that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he hangs out somewhere along the
river, or on one of the islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Nat Poole knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think so&mdash;although I am sure Nat
wants to find the fellow&mdash;why, I can&#8217;t imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>During those trying days, Job Haskers was as
harsh and dictatorial to Dave and Roger as ever,
and several times he passed sneering remarks
about those who were missing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You may think as you please, Doctor Clay,&#8221;
said he to the master of the Hall. &#8220;I feel sure
in my mind that Lawrence and those other boys
are guilty. I do not think Mr. Sparr would
accuse them if he was not pretty sure of his
ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he has not dared to have those warrants
served,&#8221; replied the doctor, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he is afraid there will be a great
deal of money used in the case to fight him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haskers, do you stand up for Mr. Sparr?
I thought you had had some difficulty yourself
with him once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was but a small affair. I think he is perfectly
honest and that he wants to do what is
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly. But he did not treat Lawrence
very fairly in the matter of that dinner that was
ordered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a mistake, and Mr. Sparr lost as
much as he got. Yes, I think those boys guilty,
and in the end you will find out that I am right,&#8221;
added Job Haskers as he went off, smiling grimly
to himself, as if it was a pleasure to him to have
the boys thus accused.</p>
<p>The next morning came another surprise. On
getting up Dave noticed that something was missing
from the dormitory. Phil&#8217;s suit-case was gone,
likewise a portion of his clothing, and also the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
valises of Ben and Buster, and part of their outfits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this beats the Dutch!&#8221; exclaimed
Roger, on learning the news. &#8220;Who took them,
do you suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, Roger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they came themselves and got them,&#8221;
suggested Sam.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they did, wouldn&#8217;t we hear them?&#8221; asked
Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk about a mysterious disappearance,&#8221;
cried Shadow. &#8220;Say, this puts me in mind of a
story. Once some fellows&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stow it, Shadow!&#8221; cried the senator&#8217;s
son. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get busy and try to find out what
this means. Maybe they are back at the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the boys dressed hastily and took a
look around. But they could find no trace of the
runaways. Yet the traveling-bags and the clothing
were certainly gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t know better, I&#8217;d say the place was
haunted!&#8221; cried Luke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t say that!&#8221; exclaimed Polly Vane,
looking scared. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to see any ghosts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Clay was informed of what had occurred,
and he had another search conducted.
But it was all to no purpose&mdash;the things were
missing, and that was all there was to it.</p>
<p>It may well be imagined that with so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
going on it was next to impossible for Dave and
Roger to study. Yet they did their best, not wishing
to drop behind again as they had during the
trip to Cave Island. Job Haskers did not let up
on them, and many a time they wished he would
leave Oak Hall and that they might never see
him again.</p>
<p>One afternoon Roger came to Dave in great
haste and beckoned for him to come outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we had better follow Nat Poole,&#8221; said
the senator&#8217;s son. &#8220;I think there is something
in the wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat has been packing a valise and he has put
in the strangest things&mdash;some clothing, some bottles
of medicine, some rope, and a thing that looks
like a crown made of brass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A crown made of brass? Oh, Roger, maybe
that wild man&mdash;who calls himself the King of
Sumatra&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea, Dave, I see you&#8217;ve caught
on. Come on, before Nat gets away from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our hero needed no further urging, and soon
he and Roger were on their way to the gymnasium,
where the senator&#8217;s son had, by pure accident,
seen Nat Poole packing the things mentioned
in his handbag.</p>
<p>As they approached, they saw the money-lender&#8217;s
son trundle out a bicycle he owned and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
mount it, swinging his valise over his shoulder by
a strap. He looked back to see if he was being
observed, but Dave and Roger were on guard
and quickly dove out of sight behind some bushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to follow on our own wheels,&#8221;
said Dave.</p>
<p>Their old bicycles were still in the gymnasium.
They were not in very good condition, but the
tires were air-tight and that was enough. Without
delay, they trundled the machines out, and
leaping into the saddles, pedaled after Nat.</p>
<p>The course of the money-lender&#8217;s son was
along the river road, and he followed this for
the best part of a mile. Then he branched off
on a side-road leading to what were known as the
Chester Hills. It was hard work pushing the machine
up the hills, but Nat kept at it steadily, and
Dave and Roger followed. Strange to say, the
money-lender&#8217;s son did not once look back after
leaving the school. Evidently he was of the
opinion that nobody had observed his departure,
or, if so, had taken no particular notice of it.</p>
<p>From the top of one of the hills, Nat struck
off on another side-road, leading to a little valley.
Here was a brook, and at a point where
it widened out, a small and really beautiful island.
In the center of the island a cabin had been built
by some sportsman, and a rustic bridge connected
the resort with the shore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>Reaching the rustic bridge, Nat dismounted,
and with his valise still over his shoulder, walked
towards the cabin. As he did this Dave and
Roger came quite close and they, too, dismounted,
keeping in the shelter of some trees near by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! I command you, in the name of the
King of Sumatra, to stop!&#8221;</p>
<p>The call came from the cabin, and a second
later the wild man appeared. He was clad in
a blue pair of trousers and over his shoulder was
thrown a big red blanket. On his head rested
a crown made of a tin pail cut into sharp
points.</p>
<p>&#8220;I salute you, King of Sumatra!&#8221; called out
Nat, making a low bow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! it is my servant that speaks,&#8221; said the
wild man. &#8220;Bow low, bow, I tell you!&#8221; and he
flourished a wooden sword that he held in one
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the wild man, sure enough!&#8221; whispered
Roger, in great excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;And evidently he has been expecting Nat,&#8221;
returned Dave. &#8220;Let us get closer and see what
is up.&#8221;</p>
<p>They advanced with care until they were behind
a tree at the very foot of the rustic bridge.
In the meantime Nat had gone forward, bowing
low at every step.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have brought you something, my king!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
cried the money-lender&#8217;s son. &#8220;Something of
great importance to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded the wild man, his
curiosity excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;A new crown. It is of gold, a beautiful
crown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! ha! that is well! The King of Sumatra
needs a new crown!&#8221; cried the wild man, strutting
up and down in front of the cabin. &#8220;Give
it to me, that I may see if it fits.&#8221; And he held
out his empty hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go into the cabin, and you can sit in
your chair of state while I place it on your head,&#8221;
said Nat, in a soothing, persuasive voice. &#8220;You
will like it, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you bring your army with you?&#8221; demanded
the wild man, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am all alone&mdash;the army is at Oakdale,&#8221;
answered Nat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again &#8217;tis well. Come in, and I will sit on
the throne,&#8221; and with a sweeping gesture of welcome,
the wild man stepped back into the cabin,
and Nat Poole followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what do you make of this?&#8221; whispered
Roger, looking at Dave in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea, Roger,&#8221; answered our hero.
&#8220;Nat knows that man; in fact, he is well acquainted
with him. I think he is going to try to
make him a prisoner.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A prisoner? Oh, I see; for the glory of it,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, to get him back to some sanitarium as
quietly as possible. I think Nat would like to do
it without anybody around here being the wiser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Then maybe the fellow is some relative
of the Pooles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly, or a close friend. But come on,
let us see what happens. We ought to try to capture
the man ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure. But I don&#8217;t see how we are
going to do it. We are unarmed, and they say
crazy folks are fearfully strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to watch our chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cabin had a window as well as a door,
and to the former the two boys crawled. Peering
through a vine that grew over the opening, they
saw that the wild man had seated himself on a
rude bench which he called his throne. It was
covered with a tattered carpet and some cabalistic
signs in blue chalk. Nat had placed his valise
on the ground and was opening it. He brought
out the crown and also the rope, but took care to
conceal the latter under his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you must close your eyes and sit perfectly
still while I place the crown on your head,&#8221;
said the money-lender&#8217;s son. &#8220;I will have to do
it from behind, for that is the way they do it in
England and Germany.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do they do it in Russia that way, too?&#8221; demanded
the wild man, and his eyes took on a
glowing look as he gazed at the brass crown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let it be so.&#8221; And the wild man sat
back on the bench and closed his eyes, and stroked
his straggly beard.</p>
<p>Quickly Nat stepped behind the man, and while
he fumbled with the crown with one hand, he
brought out the rope with the other. He was
greatly excited and his hands trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now sit perfectly still while I count fifty,&#8221;
said the money-lender&#8217;s son. &#8220;Then when
I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not finish, for at that instant the wild
man let out a sudden yell and leaped to his feet.
He ran to the doorway; and the next moment
came face to face with Dave and Roger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING OF A CLEW</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Ha! ha! you are the army sent to capture
me, are you? But I am not to be captured! Take
the cannons away! Bring up the artillery! Forward
the light brigade! Victory for the King of
Sumatra! Oh, if only I had a company of trained
monkeys I would show you how to fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus speaking, the wild man danced around
before Dave and Roger, swinging his wooden
sword close to their heads. Indeed, our hero
had to dodge back, to keep from being hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, you here?&#8221; cried Nat, coming from
the cabin. &#8220;You followed me, did you?&#8221; He
scowled deeply. &#8220;It&#8217;s just like you, Dave
Porter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody shall follow the King of Sumatra!&#8221;
went on the wild man, with a cunning look at the
three students. &#8220;Away! Out of my sight!&#8221; he
yelled.</p>
<p>He dashed past Dave and Roger, moving towards
the rustic bridge. Our hero caught him by
the arm, but received a blow in the face that staggered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
him. Roger also tried to catch the man,
but he was too quick, and a second later was on
the bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back!&#8221; bawled Nat. &#8220;Come back,
Uncle Wilbur! Don&#8217;t you know me? Come
back, please! We won&#8217;t hurt you!&#8221; And then
he set off after the wild man, who was running
along the road beyond the bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, did you hear that?&#8221; gasped the senator&#8217;s
son. &#8220;He called the wild man Uncle Wilbur!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard him,&#8221; returned our hero. &#8220;No
wonder he has been after him, Roger. Come on,
let us see if we can&#8217;t catch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chums started after the wild man and the
money-lender&#8217;s son. The way was along the road,
but presently the wild man turned into a stretch
of woods. He could run like a trained athlete,
and easily outdistanced Nat, who kept calling
after him.</p>
<p>When Dave and Roger came up they found
the money-lender&#8217;s son leaning against a tree,
out of breath and much disgusted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t get him, eh?&#8221; queried Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you fellows scared him off,&#8221; growled the
money-lender&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry if we did that,&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had no right to butt in,&#8221; grumbled Nat.
&#8220;What did you follow me for, anyway?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because we thought you were after the wild
man, that&#8217;s why,&#8221; answered Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he is your Uncle Wilbur,&#8221; went on our
hero, after a pause, and he turned a look of
sympathy at Nat as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You called him Uncle Wilbur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I guess you are mistaken,&#8221; stammered
Nat, growing red in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we heard you as plain as day,&#8221; put in
the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any right to pry into my affairs,
Roger Morr! You nor Dave Porter either!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; answered Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Nat, if we can help you we&#8217;ll do
it,&#8221; came from Dave. &#8220;I suppose, if that man is
your uncle, you wish to get him back to the&mdash;er&mdash;the
sanitarium as quickly and as quietly as possible;
is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you want to do that, if he was
your uncle?&#8221; asked the money-lender&#8217;s son, flushing
deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. But it looks, now, as if you couldn&#8217;t
do it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have done it, if you hadn&#8217;t come up
and queered my game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t see us until he ran out of the
cabin,&#8221; said Roger. &#8220;He just got a wild streak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
on, that&#8217;s all. I don&#8217;t think you could have managed
him alone. He wouldn&#8217;t let you tie him up
with that rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s gone, that&#8217;s sure,&#8221; grumbled Nat.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to the cabin for my valise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may come back,&#8221; suggested Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. But I&#8217;ll wait and see. I
hung around once for him&mdash;on that island&mdash;but
he never came back. It isn&#8217;t often he visits
the same spot twice. That&#8217;s the reason the authorities
around here haven&#8217;t caught him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is his name, Nat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilbur Poole, if you must know. He is my
father&#8217;s half-brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the Blossmore Sanitarium, in New
York state. It&#8217;s a private place, near Lake Erie.
He lost a lot of money several years ago in a
speculation in Sumatra tobacco and that made
him crazy, and that is why, I suppose, he calls
himself the King of Sumatra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know he was missing when you heard
of the wild man?&#8221; questioned Dave, with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not, for the sanitarium people did
not notify us that he had gotten away. I suppose
they thought he would stay near the institution
and that they would be able to get him again. I
can&#8217;t imagine what brought him away out here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
excepting that I went to see him once, when he
was somewhat better, and I told him about Oakdale
and our school. I knew he called himself
the King of Sumatra, and that is why I got interested
in the wild man as soon as I heard you
mention that name. Then, when the handkerchief
was found, I was sure the man was my
uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you put the hole in the handkerchief,&#8221;
said our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, because&mdash;well, I didn&#8217;t want folks to
find out from the Blossmore authorities that the
man was my uncle,&#8221; answered Nat, casting down
his eyes. &#8220;I thought I might be able to catch
him and send him back on the quiet. I didn&#8217;t
want the whole school talking about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can understand your feelings, Nat,&#8221; said
our hero, kindly. &#8220;And if I can help you in the
matter, I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll tell everybody he&#8217;s my uncle,&#8221;
came bitterly from the money-lender&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t. But I think Doctor Clay ought
to know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what of your folks?&#8221; asked Roger.
&#8220;Do they know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sent my dad a letter about it last week.
But he is away on business, so I don&#8217;t know
when he&#8217;ll get it or what he&#8217;ll do. I didn&#8217;t let the
Blossmore folks know because I don&#8217;t think my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
uncle ought to go back to that place. He ought to
be put in an institution where they are more strict,
so he can&#8217;t get away again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right there,&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat, don&#8217;t you know it is highly dangerous to
allow that man at large?&#8221; asked the senator&#8217;s
son, after a pause, during which the three boys
turned their footsteps towards the island cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think he is as dangerous as some
folks imagine,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;He has never
actually harmed anybody yet. But he scares &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may have committed some deeds of which
you know nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>At these suggestive words from the senator&#8217;s
son Nat turned pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Have you heard anything,
Roger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to hurt your feelings any further, Nat,
but I must be honest with you. Dave and I have
an idea that he was the one who blew up the
dining-room of Sparr&#8217;s hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, impossible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What Roger says is true,&#8221; said Dave, gravely.
&#8220;I am sorry for you, Nat, but that is the way it
looks to us. He was seen around the old stone
bridge when it was blown up, and around the
shanty where the dynamite was kept, and he has
been in Oakdale several times, so we have heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he wouldn&#8217;t do such a thing! He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
couldn&#8217;t!&#8221; cried the money-lender&#8217;s son, in genuine
distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;An insane man is liable to do anything, Nat,&#8221;
said Roger. &#8220;Why, he might have set off that
dynamite without realizing the consequences. The
best thing we can do is to organize a regular
search for him, and round him up as quickly as
possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that is so,&#8221; groaned Nat. &#8220;But,
oh, how I do hate the exposure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t take it too hard, Nat,&#8221; said
Dave. &#8220;Remember, neither you nor your family
are responsible for his condition of mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not take the three students long to reach
the little cabin. While Nat was packing up the
things he had brought along, Dave and Roger
looked over the place. The wild man had had
but few things, none of them worth mentioning.
There was a newspaper and an old magazine,
showing that Wilbur Poole occasionally indulged
in reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, look here!&#8221; cried Roger, as he turned
the magazine over. &#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Dave and Nat, in a
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a picture, drawn in blue pencil. It is
marked Fort, but it looks like Sparr&#8217;s hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And look what it says!&#8221; cried Dave, eying
the crude drawing. &#8220;&#8216;Powder House to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
blown up&#8217;! That&#8217;s the dining-room, as plain as
day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And down here it says, &#8216;Dynamite will do
it easily,&#8217; and signed, &#8216;King of Sumatra.&#8217; Dave,
he did it, and this proves it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly looks that way, Roger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see that drawing!&#8221; burst out Nat,
and would have snatched it from Roger&#8217;s hand
had not Dave stopped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can look at it, Nat, but you must give it
back,&#8221; said our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for? My uncle drew that and I have
a right to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am going to hand this over to Doctor
Clay and then to the Oakdale authorities. It may
be needed to clear Phil, Ben, and Buster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah, Dave, that&#8217;s the talk!&#8221; cried Roger,
with sudden enthusiasm. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of it,
but that is just what is needed to clear &#8217;em!
We&#8217;ll knock Jason Sparr&#8217;s accusations into a
cocked hat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You let me see that drawing!&#8221; shouted Nat,
making another grab for it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a right
to it&mdash;if my uncle made it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can look at it, but you can&#8217;t handle it,&#8221;
said Dave, and he gave Roger a look that the
senator&#8217;s son well understood. Both knew that
the money-lender&#8217;s son could not be trusted with
such an important bit of evidence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>The drawing was held up, but Nat was not
permitted to get too close to it. He looked it
over carelessly and then his lip curled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! I don&#8217;t think my uncle drew it,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we think he did,&#8221; returned Dave.</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence after this. Each
boy was busy with his thoughts. Dave felt particularly
light-hearted.</p>
<p>&#8220;This ought to clear Phil and the others,&#8221;
he reasoned. &#8220;And they can come back to school
without delay and finish the term and graduate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having packed up his things, Nat got out his
bicycle and prepared to ride back to Oak Hall,
and the others did the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to give me that drawing?&#8221; asked the
money-lender&#8217;s son, just as he was ready to start
off.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we are going to turn it over to Doctor
Clay,&#8221; said Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, have your own way,&#8221; growled
Nat.</p>
<p>As in coming to the cabin, the money-lender&#8217;s
son took the lead in the return to Oak Hall.
Dave and Roger kept close behind and occasionally
spoke of the happenings in guarded tones.
When the school was reached all left their bicycles
in the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to Doctor Clay now?&#8221; demanded Nat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;The sooner
he knows of this, the better for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Clay was somewhat surprised to see
the three boys, dusty and tired-looking, enter his
private office. He listened with close attention to
their tale of visiting the cabin and encountering
the wild man, and looked completely astonished
on learning that the man was Nat&#8217;s uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for you, Poole,&#8221; said he, kindly.
&#8220;But such things will happen and you must make
the best of it. It is not your fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Dave and Roger told of the finding of
the old magazine with the drawing and writing,
and Doctor Clay shook his head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad! Too bad!&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;But this clears Lawrence, Basswood, and
Beggs,&#8221; cried Dave. &#8220;And it clears Roger and
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! yes! so it does, Porter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it, Doctor Clay!&#8221; cried
Nat, leaping to his feet. &#8220;It does nothing of
the sort! That paper is no kind of evidence at
all!&#8221; And thus speaking, the money-lender&#8217;s son
glared defiantly at Dave and Roger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AFTER THE RUNAWAYS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Why, Nat, what do you mean?&#8221; demanded
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean just what I say!&#8221; declared the money-lender&#8217;s
son. &#8220;This is a frame-up, nothing more!
I understand it all now, although I didn&#8217;t at
first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;a frame-up,&#8217; Poole?&#8221;
demanded Doctor Clay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that they took this magazine and the
drawing to the cabin, that is what I mean, Doctor
Clay. They found out somehow that my&mdash;er&mdash;that
the wild man was there, and they got up this
scheme to make it look as if he had blown up the
hotel,&mdash;and they did it just to clear their cronies
and themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat, you know that is not true!&#8221; exclaimed
Roger. &#8220;I found the magazine with the drawing
on a shelf in the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is what you said, but I don&#8217;t believe
it, Roger Morr. I think you put the magazine
there yourself&mdash;you or Dave Porter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We did nothing of the kind,&#8221; cried our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you did&mdash;and I think Jason Sparr
will think so, too, when he hears the story. It&#8217;s
a frame-up, just to clear yourselves and your
cronies,&#8221; added Nat, with a sneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nat, you ought to be&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Roger, in
high anger, when Dave stopped him. Our hero
looked at Doctor Clay.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Roger says is the absolute truth, Doctor
Clay,&#8221; said our hero. &#8220;He found that magazine
on a shelf in the cabin where the wild man
was staying, and that drawing and the wording
were on it, just as you see. More than that, we
can prove that the wild man was around the old
shanty where the dynamite was kept, and that he
was seen in Oakdale several times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave was interrupted here by Nat, and a wordy
war lasting several minutes followed. Finally
Doctor Clay said he would take the magazine and
keep it, and that he would notify the authorities
in what locality the wild man might be found, provided
he had not gone away further than expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am inclined to believe the story told by Morr
and Porter,&#8221; said he somewhat sternly to Nat
Poole. &#8220;But this matter cannot be cleared up
until we find your uncle. When captured, the unfortunate
man will most likely speak of the blowing up
in some way or another, if he is guilty.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; answered Nat; but his manner
showed that he was much disturbed. Then
Dave and Roger were dismissed, and the master
of the school took Nat with him to Oakdale, to see
what could be done towards rounding up Wilbur
Poole in the near future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dave, what is the next move?&#8221; asked
the senator&#8217;s son, as the two were alone in the
lavatory, washing up after the long bicycle ride.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could find Phil and the others and
get them to come back here,&#8221; responded our
hero. &#8220;It is a great mistake for them to stay
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&mdash;it looks just as if they were
guilty. I wonder that they don&#8217;t come back on
their own account, now they have had a chance
to think it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they saw that article in the newspaper,
Roger, and it scared them worse than ever.
Maybe they imagine the officers of the law are
waiting to gobble them up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we only had some trace of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea I am going to follow up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of an idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of that baggage that left here.
Maybe it was shipped to some point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a job tracing it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can try it, anyway,&#8221; answered our hero.</p>
<p>A day slipped by and nothing more was said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
about the affair by Doctor Clay or Nat Poole.
Then Nat left the school, telling some friends he
was going home for a week&#8217;s rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most likely he is after his uncle,&#8221; was Roger&#8217;s
comment, and Dave agreed with him.</p>
<p>As soon as he could get the time Dave went
to Oakdale to see if he could find any trace of the
baggage belonging to Phil and the others who had
run away. He made many inquiries but without
success, and was on the point of returning to the
school when he happened to think of an old man
named Dowling, who did some trucking and who
knew Buster Beggs very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go around to Dowling&#8217;s place,&#8221; said he
to his chum.</p>
<p>They found the old man in a little shanty behind
his house which he called his office. It had
an old easy-chair and a desk, and on the wall was a
telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, boys,&#8221; he said, politely.
&#8220;What can I do for you? Want some baggage
shipped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I came for some information, Mr. Dowling,&#8221;
said Dave. &#8220;Have you shipped any baggage
for Buster Beggs lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the mention of the fat student&#8217;s name the
old expressman started.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to know that for?&#8221; he
demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a very good reason, Mr. Dowling. I
want to do Beggs a favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon you want to find him, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do some other folks;&#8221; and the old man
chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are his friends, and we want to find
him for his own good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who be you, if I may ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Dave Porter, and this is Roger Morr.
Buster Beggs is our friend, and so are Phil Lawrence
and Ben Basswood. They ran away and
it was foolish for them to do it. Now we
want to find them and get them to come back
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was foolish for &#8217;em to run away&mdash;I said
thet all along,&#8221; murmured the old expressman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know where they are?&#8221; put in
Roger quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you took their baggage away, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; questioned Dave, for he could see that the
old man was holding something back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow as how I moved some things for &#8217;em,
yes,&#8221; was the cautious reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they ran away?&#8221; pursued Dave.</p>
<p>The old expressman nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who got those bags from Oak Hall?&#8221; asked
Roger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s a secret,&#8221; and now the old man really
chuckled, as if he thought it was a good joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did!&#8221; declared Dave, bound to get at
the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t. Buster did&mdash;carried &#8217;em down
on his back, one at a time, in the middle o&#8217; the
night, an&#8217; nobuddy knew it! Say, they could walk
off with yer hull school if they wanted to!&#8221; And
the old expressman chuckled again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were waiting for him?&#8221; continued Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be as I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you took the baggage to the depot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And had them checked on railroad tickets?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Buster went one way, and the bags went
tudder&mdash;leas&#8217;wise so I was given to understand.
Maybe he done it to put me off the track,&#8221; continued
Isaac Dowling.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where did the bags go to?&#8221; demanded
Dave. &#8220;Come, out with it, Mr. Dowling. I give
you my word that I am acting for Buster&#8217;s good.
I wouldn&#8217;t get him into trouble for the world. He
is my chum, and so are those other boys my
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you look honest, boy, so I&#8217;ll tell ye.
The baggage was sent by express to a place called
Camptown Falls, in Maine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Camptown Falls!&#8221; cried Roger. Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
looked at Dave, who nodded, to show that he
understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Buster say he was going elsewhere?&#8221;
queried Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say so, exactly. But he mentioned
Boston, an&#8217; I thought he was goin&#8217; there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left on the train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t! He went off in the darkness,
an&#8217; that&#8217;s the last I see o&#8217; him,&#8221; concluded Isaac
Dowling, as a hail came for him to come into the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Camptown Falls,&#8221; said Dave, when he and
Roger were alone. &#8220;Can they have gone to that
out-of-the-way spot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be the place Buster would pick out,
Dave. He has often spoken of going camping up
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have mentioned Boston just to throw
old Dowling off the track.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than likely. And to think he took those
bags away while we slept!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where Phil and Ben were at the
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Maybe they were at that
camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much excited over what they had learned, Dave
and the senator&#8217;s son returned to Oak Hall. They
had expected to interview Doctor Clay and were
chagrined to learn that he had gone to New York
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
on important business and would not return for
two days. Mr. Dale had been left in charge of
the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger, do you know what I think of doing?&#8221;
said our hero. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a good notion to get permission
to leave the Hall and go after Phil and
the others. I think I can get them to come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to go along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will hardly be necessary. Besides, I&#8217;d
like somebody to stay here and watch Nat Poole,
if he comes back. Do you know, I&#8217;ve a notion that
Nat knows more about this affair than he would
like to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly acts that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to see Mr. Dale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our hero had a long talk with the head assistant,
and the upshot of this was that he got permission
to go to Maine, to look for the runaways.
He was to be gone no longer than was absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p>It did not take our hero long to prepare for
the trip. He packed a few things in a suit-case
and then he was ready. He consulted a map and
some timetables, and found he could leave Oakdale
on the first train in the morning, and by making
two changes, reach Camptown Falls about two
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. Nobody but Roger and
Mr. Dale knew that he was going away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Got money enough, have you, Dave?&#8221; questioned
the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Roger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wild kind of a spot, so Buster told
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of that&mdash;if only I can locate
the boys,&#8221; answered our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to look for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet&mdash;I&#8217;ll find out after I get
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Dave slept but little
that night. His mind was filled with what was
before him. He felt that he had quite a mission
to perform, first in locating the runaways and
then in persuading them to return to Oak Hall
to face the music.</p>
<p>He had an early breakfast, Roger eating with
him, and then the buggy, driven by Horsehair, was
brought around and he got in, and a minute later
he was off, the senator&#8217;s son waving him an adieu
from the porch of the school.</p>
<p>Dave found the first train he rode on but half
filled with passengers, and he had a double seat
to himself. He changed at the Junction, and
about noon reached Lumberport, where he was to
take the train on the little side-line for Camptown
Falls. At Lumberport he got dinner, at a hotel
frequented by lumbermen. He sat at a long table
with half a dozen men and listened to their talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
with interest when he heard Camptown Falls mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they tell me there is great danger of the
dam giving way just above Camptown Falls,&#8221; one
of the men said. &#8220;Doxey reported it hasn&#8217;t been
safe for a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, if that dam gave way it would do a lot
of damage below the Falls,&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly would,&#8221; replied a tall lumberman.
&#8220;It would wipe out some of those camps on
Moosetail Island. I rather guess the water would
cover the whole island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody ought to warn the campers,&#8221; said
another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess they know it already,&#8221; was the
answer.</p>
<p>Dave arose from the table feeling very uneasy.
He remembered the name, Moosetail Island, now.
Buster had once mentioned it, stating he had
camped there and would like to go again. Were
the runaways there now, and in danger of the dam,
should it break?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>AT THE CAMP</h3>
</div>
<p>At last the train came that was to take our
hero to the railroad station of Camptown Falls.
It was merely a flag station, but the conductor
said he would stop there for any passenger who
might wish to get off. The railroad was a single-track
affair, running through the woods and across
the country stretches, and the train consisted of
one passenger car and several freights.</p>
<p>Dave looked at the passengers and counted
them. There were just an even dozen, and of
these, ten were men, farmers and those in the
lumber business. One, a bright young fellow, sat
near our hero, and Dave resolved to ask him if
he knew anything about Camptown Falls and the
summer camps in that vicinity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know all about the Falls,&#8221; said the
young lumberman. &#8220;I work not over three miles
from there&mdash;at Cropley&#8217;s&mdash;the station this side
of Camptown. There ain&#8217;t any town, not since
the Jewell Lumber Company busted up. Some
folks camp out there, down along the river and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
on Moosetail Island, but there aren&#8217;t near as
many as there used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody said the dam above Camptown
Falls was dangerous?&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is myself, and I can&#8217;t understand
how they allow folks to camp along the river and
on that island. If that dam ever broke it would
be good-by to anybody on the island, I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been up to the island lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was there about a week ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were there then, do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple of men from Portland and half a
dozen young fellers from Springfield. There was
another camp, with some women in it, but I didn&#8217;t
get around to that, I only heard of it. There are
half a dozen camps along the right bank of the
river, but they are on high ground, and if the dam
broke it isn&#8217;t likely the water would reach &#8217;em,&#8221;
continued the young lumberman.</p>
<p>The train rolled along at a rate of twenty miles
an hour, making stops at stations and crossroads.
Here and there a person got on or off, and by the
time Camptown Falls was reached Dave had the
passenger car almost to himself.</p>
<p>The train halted for but a minute and our hero
alighted, suit-case in hand. Much to his surprise,
not a soul was about the little depot, which looked
old and dilapidated. There was a stretch of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
fields beyond the track, and farther on he made
out the glistening waters of the river, and in the
center the woodland stretch known as Moosetail
Island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this surely is Lonesome Land!&#8221; Dave
murmured to himself, as the train rumbled out
of sight and he was left utterly alone. &#8220;And
not another train until eight o&#8217;clock to-morrow
morning! I&#8217;ll have a fine time of it to-night if I
don&#8217;t meet those fellows, or run across some camp
where they will take me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave looked at the sky and this did not tend
to increase his good spirits. When he had left
Oakdale it had been warm and clear; now dark
clouds were forming overhead and it looked as if
it might rain before long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got my raincoat and a waterproof
cap, and that is one comfort,&#8221; he told himself.
&#8220;But I had better hurry up and see if I can&#8217;t
find Phil and the others before it gets too dark.
I wish there was somebody here who could tell
me where to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked around for a sign of some habitation.
Far across the river he saw a column of
smoke, coming up from among the trees, but that
was all. The only building in sight was the
deserted depot.</p>
<p>There was something of a path leading from
the depot to the river, and Dave followed this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
But soon the path seemed to divide, and the various
branches became more indistinct at every step,
especially as it was rapidly growing darker and
darker.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll strike a straight course for Moosetail
Island,&#8221; Dave said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll surely find
some people camping out there, and they may
be able to tell me about the boys, if they are
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he approached the river, going down a small
hill, the way became stony, and he had to walk
with care, for fear of going into some hole, or
twisting an ankle. It was hard work, especially
with the suit-case, and he half wished he had hidden
the baggage somewhere near the depot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a big chump that I didn&#8217;t bring some
lunch along,&#8221; he reasoned. And then he had to
smile at himself, as he remembered how he had
imagined that he might put up at some hotel in
Camptown Falls! He had not dreamed that the
place would prove such a lonely one. It was certainly
an ideal spot for runaways who wished to
remain undiscovered.</p>
<p>Presently Dave found himself at the bank of
the river, a wide but shallow stream, filled with
sandbars, rocks, and piles of driftwood. Not a
great distance off was the end of Moosetail
Island.</p>
<p>It was now so dark that our hero could see but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
little. As he stood at the edge of the river, he
heard a patter on the leaves of the trees and knew
it had begun to rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder how they get to the island?&#8221; he
mused. &#8220;They must either use canoes, or else
wade across, or ford along the stones.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved along the river-bank, and soon came
to a point where the stones in the river seemed to
stretch in a line from the bank to the island.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll try it here,&#8221; he told himself.
&#8220;But I think I had better leave the suit-case
behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>He placed the case in a tree, sheltering it as
much as possible from the rain, which was now
coming down at a lively rate. Then, donning his
raincoat and waterproof cap, he set out over the
rocks in the river, leaping from one to the next
and heading for the island.</p>
<p>It was no easy journey, and when but half-way
to Moosetail Island Dave slipped and went into
the stream up to his knees. He floundered around
for a moment, splashing the water into his face
and over his coat and cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phew! this is lots of fun!&#8221; was his grim
comment, as he at length found himself on a flat
rock, catching his breath. &#8220;Well, I am half-way
over, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remainder of the distance proved easier
traveling, and ten minutes later our hero stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
on the island. It was now raining steadily, and
the darkness of the storm had settled everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the best thing I can do is to move
right around the shore of this island,&#8221; he reasoned.
&#8220;By doing that I am bound to strike one
of the camps, sooner or later.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved along as rapidly as the rocky shore
of Moosetail Island permitted. He had to proceed
with care, for there were many dangerous
pitfalls.</p>
<p>At length his heart was gladdened by the sight
of a rude log cabin, set in the trees a little back
from the water. He hurried to it and found the
door and window closed. Evidently the spot was
deserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody here,&#8221; he murmured, and his heart
sank for the moment, for he could see that the
camp had not been used for a long time. Then
he went on, the rain in the meanwhile coming down
harder than ever. The downfall made him think
of the dam that was said to be weak. What if the
present storm should make that structure give
way?</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we were all out of this,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;I wonder if it would do any good to call?&#8221;</p>
<p>He set up a yell and listened, and then he
yelled again. From a long distance came an answering
cry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah, that&#8217;s somebody, anyway!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;I hope it was one of the boys!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stumbled in the direction of the cry. Then
he yelled once more, and again came the answering
call. But now Dave was sure it was a man&#8217;s
voice, and he was somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; he called out, a moment
later. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This way! Come this way!&#8221; was the reply,
and soon Dave passed through a patch of timber
and around some rocks and reached a spot where
there was a tiny cove, with a stretch of fine sand.
Facing the cove was a neat log cabin with a small
lean-to, the latter containing a tiny stove.</p>
<p>A tall, good-natured man stood in the lean-to,
peering out into the rain. He watched Dave&#8217;s
approach with interest. He looked to be what he
was, a camp-cook and general worker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he exclaimed, as Dave hurried in
out of the rain and shook the water from his cap.
&#8220;I thought you were one of our crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What camp is this?&#8221; questioned our hero,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it ain&#8217;t no camp in particular,&#8221; answered
the man, with a grin. &#8220;It&#8217;s jest a camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is stopping here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three young fellers and myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are their names Beggs, Lawrence, and Basswood?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve struck it. Maybe you are a friend
to &#8217;em?&#8221; went on the man, inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, and I have come a long distance to find
them,&#8221; returned Dave, and his tone of voice
showed his relief. &#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They left the camp right after dinner an&#8217; they
ain&#8217;t back yet. When you called I thought it
was one of &#8217;em, although they didn&#8217;t expect to
be back much before supper-time. But now it&#8217;s
rainin&#8217; I guess they&#8217;ll come back sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have they been here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most a week now, I guess. I didn&#8217;t come
till day before yesterday. I didn&#8217;t have nothin&#8217;
to do an&#8217; they give me a job, cookin&#8217; an&#8217; like that,&#8221;
returned the man.</p>
<p>He invited Dave to make himself at home, and
our hero was glad enough to go inside and take off
the wet raincoat and also his shoes and socks.
The baggage belonging to Phil and the others
was in the cabin, and he helped himself to dry
garments and a dry pair of slippers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all school chums,&#8221; he told the man.
&#8220;My name is Dave Porter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I heard &#8217;em talkin&#8217; about you!&#8221; cried
the camp-worker, and then said his own name was
Jerry Blutt, and that he was from Tegley, just
across the Canadian border.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not far from the border here, are
we?&#8221; asked our hero.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About six miles, thet&#8217;s all,&#8221; answered Jerry
Blutt, and this reply gave Dave another idea.
More than likely Buster and the others had chosen
this spot so that, if pursued by the officers of the
law, they could flee into Canada.</p>
<p>Jerry Blutt said the three lads had spent their
time in various ways, occasionally going fishing
and swimming. They had also written some letters
and gone to the railroad station to mail them
in the box placed there for that purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they been having a good time?&#8221; asked
Dave, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say as to that, Mr. Porter. They
did seem mighty worried over something,&#8221; answered
the camp worker, and from this our hero
felt certain that the man had not been let into
the secret of why the runaways were there at all.</p>
<p>Half an hour went by and it continued to rain
as hard as ever, while the sky remained dark and
the wind blew with more or less violence. Time
and again Dave went to the cabin door, to peer
out into the storm, but each time he turned back
disappointed. His chums were not yet in sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be surprised to see me,&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;I wonder if they will listen to reason and go
back with me? Supposing they refuse to return?
I&#8217;d hate to go back alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he questioned Jerry Blutt about the dam
above the Falls. The man shrugged his shoulders.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t safe, so they tell me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s been that way a long time, so maybe it won&#8217;t
break away yet awhile. But I&#8217;d hate to be on
the river when she does go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are there any other camps on this island?&#8221;
went on our hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now. There was some other folks, two
or three parties, I was told, but they all moved
out yesterday an&#8217; the day before. Maybe they
got afraid o&#8217; the dam,&#8221; concluded the camp-worker.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>OUT IN THE STORM</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;This is getting to be something fierce!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Dave who uttered the words, about five
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. He was looking out of
the door of the cabin, and beside him stood Jerry
Blutt.</p>
<p>The storm had kept up without intermission,
the rain coming down in a perfect torrent, and the
wind blowing in fitful gusts from the east. It
was raw and depressing, and our hero could not
help but shiver as he looked out on the turbulent
waters of the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity them fellers ain&#8217;t got back,&#8221; said
the camp-worker, with a slow shake of his head.
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t nice to be out in sech a downpour as
this, an&#8217; with sech a wind! Might a tree blow
down on &#8217;em!&#8221; And he shook his head again.</p>
<p>Dave was even more distressed than the man.
He could not get that dam out of his mind. Such
a heavy fall of rain would certainly cause a great
flow of water, and if the structure was weak, most
anything bad was liable to happen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as the boys get back I&#8217;ll urge them
to leave here,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;If that dam
breaks we want to be on high ground, where the
flood can&#8217;t reach us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears to me like the river was gittin&#8217; putty
high,&#8221; remarked Jerry Blutt, a little later, as he
watched the water in the cove closely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it would rise some with all this rain
coming down,&#8221; returned Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it might,&mdash;but I don&#8217;t know. I wish this
camp was on the shore, instid o&#8217; this island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; answered Dave, bluntly.</p>
<p>A fire had been started in the stove and a lantern
lit, and Jerry Blutt rather reluctantly began
preparations for the evening meal. But he kept
peering out of the doorway of the cabin, and
from the lean-to, and his eyes always rested on
the river, with its rain-swept, swollen surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it at all!&#8221; he said, finally. &#8220;I
wish we had moved over to the shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it is safe to stay here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t as safe as it might be. If I was
alone&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; The man stopped short.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to say it, but I think I&#8217;d go over to the
shore, till the storm was over and I knew jest
how thet dam was a-goin&#8217; to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; answered Dave.
&#8220;And if you want to go, go ahead.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to go alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish to go, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it ain&#8217;t no safer fer you than it is fer me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, too. But I want to see those other
fellows&mdash;in fact, I must see them. If I went to
the shore I might miss them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could come back later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to warn them of the danger from
the dam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could write a letter and stick it up where
they couldn&#8217;t help but see it. Then&#8211;&#8211; What&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The camp-worker stopped short, as a distant
cry reached their ears, sounding out above the
wind. An instant later the cry was repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Ben Basswood&#8217;s voice!&#8221; cried Dave.
&#8220;They must be coming back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon another voice sounded out, and our hero
recognized Buster Beggs&#8217;s tones. He ran to the
cabin door. All was dark outside, and the rain
was being driven in sheets by the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! hello!&#8221; he yelled, and catching up
the lantern, he swung it out in one direction and
another. Then he saw two forms approaching
on the run, each dripping with water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ben! And Buster!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if it isn&#8217;t Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where in the world did you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Phil?&#8221; demanded our hero.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He is somewhere behind us,&#8221; answered Buster.
&#8220;Oh, what a time we&#8217;ve had!&#8221; and entering
the cabin, the fat youth sank down on a bench
all but exhausted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to tramp for over two miles in
this rain,&#8221; explained Ben. &#8220;And of course we
had to ford to the island. Say, the current is
something fierce now! And the water is getting
higher every minute!&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you say Phil was behind you?&#8221; demanded
Dave. He still held the lantern on high.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he was&mdash;sure, he must be,&#8221; answered
Ben. &#8220;Give him a hail, will you? I&#8217;m
too tired,&#8221; and he sank on the bench beside Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil! Phil!&#8221; yelled our hero, at the top of his
lungs. &#8220;This way! This way!&#8221; and he swung
the lantern to the right and left.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you say the river is rising?&#8221; demanded
Jerry Blutt. &#8220;How high is it? Over the White
Bar yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the Bar is a foot under water,&#8221; answered
Ben. &#8220;Oh, this is a great storm!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A foot under water!&#8221; murmured the camp-worker.
&#8220;Say, we better git out! First thing
you know this hull island will be under! An&#8217; if
thet dam breaks&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the dam!&#8221; gasped Buster. &#8220;I forgot
about that! They say it isn&#8217;t safe at all! That
is why all the other campers got out! Yes, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
must leave the island and go to the shore.&#8221; He
turned to Dave. &#8220;Did you come alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Buster. I&#8217;ll tell you all about it later.
But now we must find Phil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he was right behind me,&#8221; came
from Ben. He looked greatly distressed. &#8220;I
wonder if anything happened to him? Maybe he
slipped off the rocks into the river!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must look for him!&#8221; cried Dave, and
reached for his coat and cap. &#8220;Show me the
way you came, Ben.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ben was nothing loath, and side by side the
two chums ran outside into the storm, and in the
direction of the upper end of the island. They
had gone but a short distance when they reached
a low spot and here suddenly found themselves in
water several inches deep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, you are taking me into the river!&#8221;
cried Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the river!&#8221; answered Ben, with a
gasp. &#8220;Gosh! how the water is rising! This
was dry when I came over it before!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dry!&#8221; ejaculated our hero. &#8220;Ben, are you
sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Positive! Say, the water is rising to beat
the band! I guess we had better get out! If we
don&#8217;t we&#8217;ll have to swim for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil! Phil! Where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Standing in water up to his ankles, our hero
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
called again and again, and Ben joined in the
cry. The lantern was flashed in all directions.
But nothing was seen or heard of the missing
student.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure he started to follow us across the
river,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;Buster was in front, I came
next, and Phil was in the rear. I asked him twice
if he was all right and he said he was. Then it
blew so hard, and the rain got so heavy, none of
us said any more. Oh, Dave, what shall we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know Ben&mdash;wish I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he slipped off the rocks and
was&mdash;was&mdash;drowned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was, wouldn&#8217;t it be terrible?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>A cry came from behind them, and Buster appeared,
followed by Jerry Blutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Phil?&#8221; demanded the stout youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The water is terribly high, and Jerry thinks
we had better move to the shore. He says we
might be drowned if that dam should break.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we ought to find Phil first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;if we can. Maybe he went back, when
he found out how the water was rising,&#8221; went on
the stout youth, hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d desert us,&#8221; answered Ben.
&#8220;That isn&#8217;t Phil&#8217;s style.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Ben,&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>All splashed around in the water for several
minutes, but without making any discovery of importance.
The river was now rising more
rapidly than ever, and the camp-worker showed
increased nervousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t no two ways about it&mdash;the dam&#8217;s bust!&#8221;
he cried, at last. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to git out, an&#8217; I
advise all o&#8217; you to do the same. If you want
me to carry anything to shore I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t carry any trunks in such a hurry,&#8221;
said Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us carry our suit-cases and bundles,&#8221; said
Ben.</p>
<p>With heavy hearts, Dave and the others returned
to the cabin. The water in the cove had
now risen so high that it swept the edge of the
lean-to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we get to shore?&#8221; asked Buster. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t any boat,&#8221; he added, turning to Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can if you&#8217;ll hurry,&#8221; replied Jerry Blutt.
&#8220;Every minit lost makes it jest so much more
dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>In great haste Ben and Buster and the camp-worker
gathered together such belongings as they
could conveniently carry. The other things were
placed in a trunk and hoisted by ropes into a big
tree. Then a lantern was tied on a post in front
of the cabin and to it was fastened a brief note,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
for Phil&#8217;s benefit, stating they had gone to the
shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope he is safe!&#8221; murmured Dave,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; added his chums.</p>
<p>Jerry Blutt led the way along the shore of the
island and then out into the stream. They had the
second camp lantern with them, one belonging to
Jerry. He led the way from rock to rock, and
they followed in single file, Dave bringing up the
rear. Ever and anon our hero looked back for
some sign of Phil, but without avail.</p>
<p>Once out in the river, all were certain that the
dam above Camptown Falls had burst. The water
ran with great rapidity and was filled with dirt
and d&eacute;bris of various kinds. On the rocks that
were low they had all they could do to keep their
footing.</p>
<p>The most dangerous part of the river had yet
to be passed&mdash;a section close to the shore, where
the water was deep and the rocks for fording few.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind your footin&#8217; here!&#8221; sang out the camp-worker.
&#8220;An&#8217; if you slip, look out thet you don&#8217;t
hurt yourselves!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was splashing along in water up to his
knees, sometimes on the rocks and then again on
a sandbar running in that direction. Then he had
to make a turn, to avoid a deep portion of the
stream, where the current was rapid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>Ben was behind the man and Buster was just
ahead of Dave. As all struggled along, there
came an extra heavy blast of wind, followed by
a perfect deluge of rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; screamed Buster, an instant later, and
peering through the rain, Dave saw him suddenly
throw up his arms and slip from a rock. There
was a splash, and poor Buster disappeared from
view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buster is in the river!&#8221; yelled our hero, and
then he leaped for the rock from which the stout
youth had fallen. He looked down and saw an
arm and a head come up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help! hel&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; came from the unfortunate
one, and then the swift current caught him and
turned him over, out of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help!&#8221; yelled Dave, to attract the attention
of those ahead. And then, as he saw Ben turn
back, he slipped down on the rock and into the
swirling river and struck out after Buster.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>PERILS OF THE FLOOD</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dave! Dave!&#8221; yelled Ben, as he saw our
hero disappear into the swiftly-flowing river.
&#8220;Look out, or you&#8217;ll both be drowned!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; yelled Jerry Blutt, as
he turned back for the first time since leaving the
island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buster slipped in, and Dave went after him,&#8221;
answered Ben. &#8220;Oh, what shall we do?&#8221; he went
on, despairingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&mdash;we&#8217;ll throw out the rope!&#8221; answered
the camp-worker, and took from his shoulder a
rope he carried.</p>
<p>In the meantime Dave had come up and was
striking out with might and main for his chum.
Our hero realized that Buster must be hurt, otherwise
he would swim to save himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have struck on his head, when he went
over,&#8221; he thought, and he was right, poor Buster
had done just that and now lay half-unconscious
as the current swept him further and further
from his friends.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>It was too dark to see much, and Dave had all
he could do to keep in sight of the unfortunate
one. But presently the stout youth&#8217;s body struck
against a rock and was held there, and our hero
came up and seized the lad by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buster! Buster!&#8221; he called out. &#8220;What&#8217;s
wrong? Can&#8217;t you swim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hel&mdash;help me!&#8221; gasped the fat youth. &#8220;I&mdash;I
got a knock on the head. I&#8217;m so&mdash;so dizzy I
do&mdash;don&#8217;t know what I&mdash;I&#8217;m do&mdash;doing!&#8221;</p>
<p>The current now tore Buster away from the
rock, and he and Dave floated along on the bosom
of the river for a distance of fifty yards. It was
impossible to do much swimming in that madly-rushing
element and Dave wisely steered for
shore. He continued to support his friend, who
seemed unable to do anything for himself.</p>
<p>At length, when our hero was all but exhausted,
his feet struck a sandbar. At once he stood up,
finding himself in water that reached to his
waist. He caught up Buster and placed the weakened
lad over his shoulder. In a dim, uncertain
way he saw the shore loom up in front of him,
and struck out in that direction.</p>
<p>It was a short but hard struggle. Twice Dave
went down, once losing his hold on his chum.
But he got up each time and went after Buster in
a hurry. Then he made a final dash, came in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
contact with some bushes, and hauled himself and
his burden to temporary safety.</p>
<p>All was dark around the two boys, and the
rain came down as pitilessly as ever. But for
this they did not, just then, care. They had been
close to death, and now they were safe, and that
counted for everything.</p>
<p>Poor Buster had received a severe bump on the
forehead and had a swelling there of considerable
size. But the stunning effect was passing, and he
was able to sit up and peer around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a crack I got, when I fell over!&#8221;
he murmured, and then he added, gratefully: &#8220;It
was a fine thing for you to jump in after me,
Dave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I couldn&#8217;t stand there and see you
drown, Buster,&#8221; answered our hero. &#8220;I had to do
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up the stream&mdash;unless they went overboard,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose we ought to walk that
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will&mdash;after we get our breath and you
feel strong enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you can call to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave yelled at the top of his voice, not once but
several times. Presently an answering hail arose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
from a distance, and then Ben came running up,
followed by Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave! Buster! Are you safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered both.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so glad! We were afraid you were
both drowned! How did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two told their story, and then the others
told how they had thrown out the rope and had
seen Dave disappear in the darkness after Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have jumped in, too, but I didn&#8217;t see
how I could do any good,&#8221; went on Ben. &#8220;Jerry
said we had better come ashore and look for you
down here. So we did that. My! but it&#8217;s a fearful
flood, isn&#8217;t it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I wish we knew where Phil was,&#8221; and
Dave heaved a deep sigh. Had their chum lost
his life in that rapidly-rising river?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t no ust to stay here&mdash;gitting wetter an&#8217;
wetter,&#8221; said the camp-worker, after a pause.
&#8220;Besides, if that flood gits wuss it is bound to
come up here. We better git further back&mdash;up
the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any shelter around here? I mean
on high ground?&#8221; asked Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know of a cabin up on the hill,&#8221; answered
Buster. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I can find it in
the rain and darkness, but I can try.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked along, through the trees, until he
reached a footpath running up from the shore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
They followed the path for about a hundred
yards, and then came in sight of a long, low,
rambling cabin, the home in years gone by of some
lumbermen. It was in a dilapidated state, with
doors and windows gone, but it would provide a
roof over their heads, and that was something.</p>
<p>Entering, the lantern was hung on a nail,
and they looked around them. There was a fireplace,
with some dry sticks handy, and soon they
had a fire started, which added much to the comfort
of the surroundings. They hung up the
majority of their wet garments and sat close to
the blaze, drying themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I only knew where to look for Phil, I&#8217;d go
after him,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;But to look for him
in the darkness is like looking for the proverbial
needle in the haystack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to go out first thing in the morning,&#8221;
returned Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, as soon as we can see,&#8221; added Buster.</p>
<p>The boys who had run away were anxious to
learn what Dave had to say about affairs at Oakdale,
and in a low voice, while the camp-worker
was preparing hot coffee and something to eat, he
related what had happened since their departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You made a big mistake to run away,&#8221; he
said, earnestly. &#8220;Just because you did that, many
folks feel sure you must be guilty. You ought to
go right back and face the music.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you are right, Dave,&#8221; answered Ben,
shamefacedly. &#8220;But when Phil said &#8216;run,&#8217; I
didn&#8217;t stop to think, but just got out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is what I did, too,&#8221; added the
stout youth. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t blame Phil any more
than I blame myself,&#8221; he added, hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor do I,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;We made a big mistake.
We should have stood our ground, like
you and Roger did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you come back with me, and we&#8217;ll face
this to a finish,&#8221; went on our hero. &#8220;But, of
course, we&#8217;ve got to find Phil first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only the camp-worker slept well that night.
The boys were restless, and several times one or
another got up, to go to the doorway and
listen, thinking he had heard a call from Phil.
But the calls were only imaginary, and morning
dawned without a sign of the missing one.</p>
<p>It was still raining, but not so hard as before,
and by eight o&#8217;clock the clouds broke away and
the sun commenced to shine. All had an early
breakfast, from the stores brought along, and
then the party hurried down to the river.</p>
<p>That the dam above Camptown Falls had
broken was plainly evident on all sides. During
the night the river had risen seven or eight feet,
bearing on its bosom many trees and bushes, with
here and there the remains of camps that had been
located on low ground. Moosetail Island had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
been swept from end to end, only the higher spots
escaping the flood. The waters were now going
down, the rush from the broken dam having
spent itself.</p>
<p>The boys gave scant heed to the destruction
effected by the rain and the broken dam. All
their thoughts were centered on Phil. What had
become of their chum? Was he dead or alive?</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if it wouldn&#8217;t be best to get over
to the island and look around?&#8221; suggested Dave.
&#8220;Most likely he went there&mdash;thinking you would
be at the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how are we to get to the island?&#8221; asked
Buster. He had no desire to fall into the turbulent
stream again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the water is going down rapidly, Buster.
I think we can make it by noon.&#8221;</p>
<p>All walked up and down the river bank, looking
in vain for some trace of the shipowner&#8217;s son.
Once they met some people from another camp
and asked about Phil. But these folks shook
their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t see a soul,&#8221; said one of the men.</p>
<p>Jerry Blutt had been looking the situation
over carefully, and he said he thought they could
get to the island by going up the river a distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the current will help us along, and we
won&#8217;t have to fight so hard,&#8221; said the camp-worker.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
He did not like the idea of crossing the
water, but did not wish to desert the boys.</p>
<p>On the trip they carried the rope, with Jerry at
the head and Dave at the rear. All took tight
hold, so that if one slipped the others might pull
him up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, take it easy,&#8221; cautioned the camp man.
&#8220;This water is runnin&#8217; putty swift, even yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had mapped out a course with his eye, and
proceeded slowly and cautiously. Once away
from the shore, they felt the full force of the onrushing
waters and were all but swept from their
feet. It was well that they were a good distance
above Moosetail Island, for to reach this spot by
going straight out in the stream would have been
impossible.</p>
<p>It was a long, hard, and dangerous trip, and all
drew a deep breath of relief when they finally set
foot on the island. At times they had been in
water up to their waists and it had looked as if
they must surely be swept away. Once a tree
branch, coming swiftly along, had caught Dave
and literally carried him off his feet for several
yards.</p>
<p>They landed at one end of the island, at a point
where the bushes were still two feet under water.
The evidences of the flood were on every hand,
and the water was muddy and filled with broken-away
brushwood and trees.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we had better strike out for the
camp,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;Phil would go there if he
went anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they advanced one or another gave a loud
call. But no answer came back, and this made
them look gravely at each other. Was the perilous
trip to the island to prove a vain one?</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour they came in sight of
the camp. The cove had been blotted out, and
the water was eddying around the cabin to a depth
of several inches. Mud was everywhere, inside
the place and out, and this showed that the flood
had swept the spot at a height of several feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might have stayed here,&#8221; was Buster&#8217;s
comment. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t hurt the big tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t know how bad it was going to
be,&#8221; answered Ben. &#8220;It might have washed away
the whole island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go up to the high ground and look for
Phil,&#8221; suggested Dave. &#8220;Maybe he went to the
highest spot he could find.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others agreed, and leaving the camp-worker
at the cabin, the boys, led by Buster,
tramped through the wet and mud to a little hill.
Again they set up their calls, but, as before, no
answer came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he came here,&#8221; said Ben, at
last. &#8220;If he was here he would surely hear
us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he was hurt and couldn&#8217;t answer,&#8221; returned
Dave.</p>
<p>From the top of the little hill they could see
both ends of Moosetail Island and also both
shores of the river. As they gazed about them,
Dave suddenly gave a shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! look!&#8221; he cried, pointing to the shore
which they had left but a short while before.
&#8220;There is somebody waving a handkerchief at
us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Phil!&#8221; returned Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; questioned Buster. &#8220;I can
see it is a man or a boy, but that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like Phil,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;Oh, I hope
it is!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>BACK TO THE SCHOOL</h3>
</div>
<p>They waved frantically to the person on the
shore, and he waved frantically in return, and at
last all were convinced that it must really be their
missing chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must think I am Jerry,&#8221; said Dave.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t he be surprised to see me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be, unless he was at the cabin last
night and read the note,&#8221; returned Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;The note wasn&#8217;t touched,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;I
noticed that it was exactly as we left it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All gave a parting wave and pointed to the
shore, and then left the hill. They made their way
down to the cabin, and told the camp-worker
what they had seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be Lawrence,&#8221; said Jerry Blutt.
&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;ll come over here, instead of waiting
for us to go to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, I never thought of that!&#8221; cried
Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be like the men in one of Shadow&#8217;s
stories,&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;One was upstairs in a big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
office building and one downstairs. The man upstairs
went down, and the downstairs man went
up, and they kept that up until both stopped,
tired out, one upstairs and one down.&#8221; And
the others had to smile at the brief yarn.</p>
<p>All journeyed to the lower shore of the island,
where they could get a better view of the spot
where the person they thought was Phil had been.
They saw the party walking up the river bank,
looking for a good place to ford. All shouted
loudly and waved their hands to keep him where
he was, and he nodded his head deeply, to show
that he understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be Phil,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;Oh, how
thankful I am that he wasn&#8217;t carried away by the
flood!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys were impatient to get back to the
shore, and Jerry Blutt did not blame them. To
carry any of the stuff over was still out of the question,
and they did not attempt it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can come and get it some day, Jerry,&#8221;
said Buster. &#8220;You can ship it to us by express,
and we&#8217;ll pay you for your trouble;&#8221; and so it
was arranged.</p>
<p>It was as hard to gain the shore as it had been
to reach the island, and all were well-nigh exhausted
when they finally left the water, not to
return again. Phil saw them coming, and when
he made out Dave he was almost dumfounded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where in the world did you come from?&#8221;
he demanded, as he caught our hero by the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Oakdale, Phil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you run away, too?&#8221; demanded the shipowner&#8217;s
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; answered Dave, with a grin. &#8220;I
came to bring you fellows back. But first tell us,
how did you get out of the flood last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I had a fierce time of it. I tried to get
back to the camp, but stumbled over some tree-roots
and went down in a hole and hurt my ankle.
When I got up I couldn&#8217;t see the others, and I
must have lost my way. Then it began to rain
and get dark, and I didn&#8217;t know which way to
turn. I yelled dozens of times, but I didn&#8217;t hear
any answer. I tried to locate the cabin, but I
must have been completely turned around, for I
came out on the shore. Then the flood came
along, and before I knew it I was floating down
the river. I hit a tree and clung to that, and
we drifted a mile or more before the tree got
stuck on a sandbar. I stayed there, in the rain
and darkness, until morning and then waded and
swam ashore. I was so tired out I had to rest for
awhile, and then I came up here, to try to find out
something about our crowd. I was thinking of
getting over to the island again when I saw you
on the top of the hill. Of course, I thought Dave
was Jerry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We were scared to death, thinking you had
been drowned,&#8221; said Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I came pretty close to it,&#8221; was the serious
reply. &#8220;No more such flood for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>All turned towards the cabin where four of
the party had spent the night, and there Jerry
was called on to prepare the best meal their limited
stores afforded. On the river-bank they had
picked up some fish cast up by the flood, and these
were broiled, making a welcome addition to the
meal.</p>
<p>While the meal was being prepared, and after
it had been eaten, Dave had a serious talk with
Phil and the others, and all realized the folly they
had committed in running away from Oak Hall.
Phil in particular, was much disturbed and said he
had been thinking of coming back.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we saw that article in the newspaper,
and it scared us,&#8221; went on the shipowner&#8217;s son.
&#8220;Of course, it didn&#8217;t mention any names, but we
knew it was meant for us. I know now, just as
well as the others, that it was a mistake to run
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, you&#8217;ll go back with me?&#8221; questioned
Dave, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll go back, too, Ben and Buster?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am mighty glad to hear it&mdash;and I feel that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
this thing will come out all right in the end,&#8221; returned
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, there is one thing I haven&#8217;t told
you, Dave,&#8221; said Buster, a minute later. &#8220;The
general excitement drove it clean out of my head.
We know who it was that spoiled the feast Phil
got up for the crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221; asked our hero, with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It was Nat Poole. He went to Rockville
and sent those telephone messages to Jason
Sparr and that musical professor, calling the whole
affair off. He did it because he wasn&#8217;t invited to
take part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you learn this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard it the night I went to the Hall to get
our baggage. When I was in hiding, waiting for
a chance to go to the dormitory, I saw Nat Poole
come in, along with that new student, Will Fasey.
They had been out somewhere having a good time,
and Nat was telling Fasey how he had sent the
telephone messages and queered the feast. I
would have pitched into him then and there only
I didn&#8217;t dare expose myself,&#8221; went on the stout
youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll get what is coming to him from me,
when I get back to the school,&#8221; put in Phil. &#8220;It
was a contemptible piece of business, and I want
everybody to know it. Besides, he has got to pay
for what I lost by the transaction.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for that, maybe we wouldn&#8217;t have
been suspected of blowing up the hotel,&#8221; said
Ben. &#8220;Then you really think the wild man did
it, Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what of that letter Jason Sparr got, saying
our crowd was guilty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to make of that, Ben. I
don&#8217;t think the wild man could write that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would Nat Poole be bad enough to do
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe. But it was an awful thing to do.
I didn&#8217;t think Nat would be as mean as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys had dried and pressed their clothing
as best they could, and put on clean collars, cuffs,
and neckties, and therefore looked quite presentable
once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as we get to town we can get cleaned
up a little better,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;So we won&#8217;t look
quite like tramps when we return to the Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to face Doctor Clay,&#8221; remarked Phil,
dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; added Ben and Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it has got to be done,&#8221; answered Dave.
&#8220;So make the best of it. The doctor understands
the situation, so I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll be hard on
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they have got the wild man, and that
they prove he blew up the hotel,&#8221; said Phil, wistfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
&#8220;That is the only thing that will really
clear us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they are bound to get the wild man sooner
or later,&#8221; answered Dave, hopefully.</p>
<p>It was decided to take the one afternoon train
from Camptown Falls, and at the proper time
the boys walked to the little depot, Dave with
his suit-case, and the others with some hand baggage.
Instructions were left with Jerry Blutt regarding
the other baggage, and the man was paid
for his services. He said he was glad that nobody
had been drowned in the flood, and added
that he was going up to the broken-away dam later
on to see how matters looked.</p>
<p>It was a rather quiet crowd that got aboard the
train when it came along. The conductor wanted
to know how they had fared in the flood, and they
told him. At Lumberport the boys had to wait an
hour for the next train to Oakdale Junction, and
they spent the time in getting a good supper, and
in having their shoes shined, and in brushing up
generally.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to get back late at night,&#8221; said
Phil to Dave. &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to have the whole crowd
staring at us when we came in.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the Junction they waited but a few minutes,
and the run to Oakdale did not take long. They
were the only ones to get off at the depot, and
the spot was all but deserted. But they had telegraphed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
ahead, and Horsehair was on hand, with
a carriage, to meet them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you young gents back, indeed I
am,&#8221; said the school driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any news, Horsehair?&#8221; asked Dave, as they
piled into the carriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as I know of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they got that wild man yet?&#8221; questioned
Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. But they seen him&mdash;along the river&mdash;day
before yesterday. He was sleepin&#8217; in a
barn. But he got away before the farmer and
his man could git him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where was that?&#8221; questioned Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up to the Morrison place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Morrison place,&#8221; mused Buster. &#8220;I
know that family. When I get a chance I am
going to ask them about this,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>When the boys arrived at Oak Hall they found
Doctor Clay sitting up to receive them. He smiled
at Dave, but was somewhat cold towards the
others.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too late to listen to what you have to say
to-night,&#8221; said he. &#8220;All of you may report in my
office directly after our opening exercises in the
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the boys went upstairs there were a good
many exclamations of surprise, and Roger and the
others wanted to ask innumerable questions. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
a monitor cut all talk short, and Dave and the
runaways got to bed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>All were up early, and Dave, Phil, and the
others had to tell their story before going down
to breakfast. Roger and those who had been left
behind with him listened eagerly to the tale of the
flood and the other happenings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Dave got there just in time,&#8221; said the
senator&#8217;s son. &#8220;How about it, Buster?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure did,&#8221; said the stout lad, and shuddered
to think how close he had been to drowning.</p>
<p>It can well be imagined that Phil, Ben, and
Buster did not have much appetite for breakfast.
Phil looked around for Nat Poole, but the money-lender&#8217;s
son had not yet returned to the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, tell me everything,&#8221; said Doctor Clay,
when the boys at length filed into his office. &#8220;As
they say in court, we want the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is what I&#8217;m going to give you, Doctor
Clay,&#8221; answered Phil. &#8220;I made a big mistake
in running away, and I am glad Dave came to
bring us back. I haven&#8217;t done anything wrong,
and I am here to face the music, as the saying
goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so am I,&#8221; came from Ben and Buster.</p>
<p>Then the boys told their story in detail, omitting
nothing, and Dave related how he had gone
to Camptown Falls, and how the flood had caught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
him. In the midst of the narrative came a sharp
knock on the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said the doctor, and one of the
servants entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man to see you, sir,&#8221; said the servant.
&#8220;He says it is very important&mdash;something about
that wild man, sir! He&#8217;s terribly excited, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wild man again!&#8221; murmured the master
of the school, while the boys looked at him and the
servant with interest. &#8220;Show the visitor in and I
will hear what he has to say.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE TRAIL THROUGH THE WOODS</h3>
</div>
<p>In a minute the servant ushered in a farmer
whom the boys recognized as Henry Morrison, a
man who had a farm along the river-front, about a
mile from Oak Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, sir,&#8221; said the farmer, bowing
to the doctor and then to the boys. &#8220;Excuse
me for being in such a hurry, but I thought you
would like to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to hear what you have to say,
Mr. Morrison,&#8221; replied the master of the school.
&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; and he pointed to a handy chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about that wild man, Doctor Clay!&#8221; exclaimed
the farmer, dropping into the seat and
mopping his forehead with his handkerchief.
&#8220;It&#8217;s something terribul, the way he carries on.
He &#8217;most scared my wife to death!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been to your place again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, last night. He was in the barn, and
he jumped out at my wife and said he was going to
blow the fort to pieces! She got so scared she
dropped her pailful of milk and ran to the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
I got mad and got my shotgun, but the fellow
had skipped out before I could catch sight of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What time was this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about six o&#8217;clock. But that ain&#8217;t all.
This morning I started for town, intending to tell
the constable and the justice about it, when all of
a sudden, when I was passing the end of your
property, I see the wild man down there, behind
a tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just now?&#8221; asked Dave, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more&#8217;n a quarter of an hour ago. That&#8217;s
why I stepped in here. He&#8217;s a dangerous man,
Doctor Clay, and I think he ought to be rounded
up!&#8221; went on Henry Morrison, earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, he certainly ought to be put
under restraint,&#8221; answered the master of Oak
Hall. &#8220;I will see to this at once. Will you assist
in the hunt, Mr. Morrison?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;if I don&#8217;t have to go alone. I
don&#8217;t think it is safe for anybody to tackle him
alone, he&#8217;s that wild and dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we take part in the search?&#8221; asked Phil,
eagerly. &#8220;Oh, do let us do it, Doctor Clay!&#8221; he
pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so, if you will promise to be careful.
Mr. Morrison, can you point out the exact
spot where you saw the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I can.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will at once make up a searching
party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Clay could act quickly when the occasion
demanded, and inside of ten minutes a searching
party was made up, composed of Dave and his
chums, Mr. Dale, Horsehair, and several men
who chanced to be working around the grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope we catch him and are able to prove
that he blew up the hotel dining-room,&#8221; said Phil
to Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I, Phil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henry Morrison led the way, and it was not
long before the spot was gained where he had seen
Wilbur Poole. From that point a path ran from
the river back into the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he took that path,&#8221; suggested our
hero, and several thought the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we had better scatter,&#8221; suggested Mr.
Dale, who had been placed in charge by the doctor.
&#8220;By doing that we can cover a wide range
of territory in a comparatively short space of
time. And keep as quiet as possible, for should
he hear us he will most likely start and run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he didn&#8217;t run when he saw Mr. Morrison,&#8221;
murmured Buster. &#8220;He may be miles away already.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd separated into pairs, Dave and Phil
going together and Roger going with Ben, and
Buster with Horsehair. All had armed themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
with sticks, and Mr. Dale carried a pair of handcuffs,
and one of the hired men had a rope.</p>
<p>Deeper and deeper into the woods went the
party, spread out in a long line. They had examined
the river-front and felt fairly certain that
the wild man had not left by boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a wild-goose chase,&#8221; remarked
Phil, with a sigh, after a half an hour had
passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t want to give up yet,&#8221; answered
Dave. &#8220;Why, it isn&#8217;t much after ten o&#8217;clock.
We can stay out till noon, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d stay out all day, if I thought we could
catch him,&#8221; returned the shipowner&#8217;s son,
promptly.</p>
<p>Presently the boys espied a small stone house,
standing beside a brook which flowed through
the woods into the river. In the house lived an
old man who made his living by making baskets
and fancy articles of birch bark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see if old Herick is around,&#8221; suggested
Dave. &#8220;He may be able to tell us something.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found the old man hard at work on a
fancy basket. He looked surprised when thus
suddenly confronted by the students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I see a wild man?&#8221; he queried, in reply
to their question. &#8220;I guess I did,&mdash;at least he
acted queer enough. He danced up here, made a
deep bow, and told me the army would be along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
in four minutes. Then he made another bow and
walked off, as stiff as a drum-major.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When was this?&#8221; demanded Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;About half an hour ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And which way did he go?&#8221; put in Phil,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That way,&#8221; and the old basket-maker pointed
up the brook. &#8220;Walked right in the water, too.
I was going to follow him at first but then I didn&#8217;t
think it was any use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys waited to hear no more, but telling
old Herick to watch for the other searchers and
tell them about the wild man, they set off up the
brook as fast as they could travel.</p>
<p>As the chums progressed they looked to the
right and left, wondering if Wilbur Poole had
kept to the tiny watercourse or taken to the woods,
which were now exceedingly dense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see his footprints!&#8221; cried Phil, as they
passed a sandy stretch. &#8220;Anyway, those marks
look fresh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy you are right, Phil, and if so, he can&#8217;t
be very far ahead of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went on, following the windings of the
stream until it became less than a foot wide. It
came to an end at a number of springs among the
rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine, cold water,&#8221; announced Dave. &#8220;Here
is a chance for a good drink, Phil.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>Both were drinking their fill when a loud voice
suddenly challenged them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! What are you doing at my fountain?&#8221;</p>
<p>Both looked up hurriedly and saw the wild man
standing on the highest of the rocks. He had his
arms folded and was glaring at them sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; murmured Phil. &#8220;Say, Dave, there
he is! What shall we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us try to make friends with him,&#8221; suggested
Dave. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t, he may run away,
and he can easily do that in these thick woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could only notify the others!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can go back if you wish, while I talk to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I reckon I can take care of myself,&#8221; answered
Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you not know I gave a million dollars for
these fountains?&#8221; went on the wild man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they are worth it,&#8221; answered Dave,
calmly. &#8220;It is very good water. Why don&#8217;t
you have it bottled, Mr. Poole?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who calls me Poole? I am the King of
Sumatra. My army is following me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To blow up another fort, I suppose,&#8221; said
Phil, as he commenced to back away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must go, for I don&#8217;t want to be blown
up,&#8221; and, so speaking, Phil commenced to retreat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The fort is not here&mdash;it is in Oakdale, close
to the other fort,&#8221; said the wild man, and now he
came down from the big rock and stood quite
close to Dave. There was a strange look of cunning
in his eyes, and Dave had to shiver, although
he did his best to keep calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Oakdale,&#8221; said Dave, slowly. &#8220;Say, you
blew up that hotel fort in fine shape, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! ha! so I did! But I was discovered,
worse luck, I was discovered!&#8221; continued the wild
man, with a sad shake of his head. &#8220;The enemy
saw me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody saw you?&#8221; queried our hero, with
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, worse luck. But it shan&#8217;t happen again.
Next time I shall go masked. I have my mask
here.&#8221; And Wilbur Poole pulled from his pocket
a mask made of a bit of blue cloth. &#8220;I will show
you how I wear it.&#8221; And he fastened it over his
face by means of a couple of strings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine! fine!&#8221; cried Dave, in pretended delight.
He wished to humor the man until Phil returned
with the others. &#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be better. You
ought to patent that kind of a mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will patent it soon, after the other fort is
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You just said somebody saw you when you
blew up the other,&#8221; continued our hero. &#8220;Who
was it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! that is a state secret. Only the cabinet
must know of it&mdash;the cabinet and the man who
makes shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry you won&#8217;t let me in on your
secrets,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;I want to help you. Won&#8217;t
you hire me as a clerk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you want a week?&#8221; demanded
the wild man, in a business-like tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much will you give?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To a good clerk forty dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll take the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. Your name is Crusoe, isn&#8217;t it&mdash;Robinson
Crusoe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I give you the job, you must have your hair
shaved off,&#8221; continued the wild man, looking at
Dave&#8217;s hair critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll have that done when we reach
a barber shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary to wait!&#8221; cried Wilbur
Poole. &#8220;I am a barber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure&mdash;I have a certificate from the
Emperor of Siam. See here!&#8221;</p>
<p>The wild man put his hand into an inner pocket
and suddenly brought forth a pair of long shears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can cut your hair and shave you,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Just sit down on yonder throne and
I&#8217;ll start to work.&#8221; And he pointed to a flat rock.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>The sight of the sharp-pointed shears was not a
pleasant one, and when the wild man invited him
to sit down Dave felt very much like running
away. The man evidently saw how he felt, and
suddenly caught him by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down!&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;I won&#8217;t hurt
you. I am an expert barber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us talk about the job first,&#8221; said Dave,
trying to keep his wits about him, although he was
terribly disturbed. He wondered how long it
would be before Phil would return.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you cut my hair in the latest fashion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never cut hair in any other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you curl the ends? I like curls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want them, although they make a man
look girlish,&#8221; answered the wild man.</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; went on Dave, when Wilbur
Poole suddenly grabbed him by both arms
and forced him backwards on the flat rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to work at once!&#8221; cried the wild man.
&#8220;Sit still!&#8221; And he flourished the shears before
our hero&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Dave felt a chill run down his backbone. But
a moment later he felt a thrill of relief, as from
the bushes behind the wild man stepped Phil, Mr.
Dale, and several others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE CAPTURE OF THE WILD MAN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Now then, you may go to work,&#8221; said our
hero, as he saw Mr. Dale come up close behind
the wild man. &#8220;But sharpen the scissors first,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; was Wilbur Poole&#8217;s answer, and he
opened up the shears and commenced to stroke
them back and forth on a rock near by.</p>
<p>An instant later the wild man was jerked over
backwards and the dangerous shears were
snatched from his grasp. He commenced to struggle,
but the whole crowd surrounded him, and
before he could realize the situation his hands
were made fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is treachery, base treachery!&#8221; he groaned.
&#8220;My army has betrayed me!&#8221; And he commenced
to weep.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a terrible state of mind to be in!&#8221;
murmured Roger. &#8220;He is certainly as crazy as
they make &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you are right,&#8221; answered Phil. &#8220;But
I am glad we have got him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He spoke about the blowing up of the hotel,&#8221;
said Dave. &#8220;And he said somebody saw him
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mention any names.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he was simply wandering in his mind,&#8221;
suggested Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; returned Dave. &#8220;I think,
if he was questioned long enough, we could get
the truth out of him. He doesn&#8217;t seem to be
crazy all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible thing for the Poole family&mdash;to
have such a crazy man in it,&#8221; was Buster&#8217;s opinion;
and the other lads agreed with him.</p>
<p>The prisoner was marched along the brook, past
the home of old Herick, and then down the river-road.
By this time all the searchers had come
together, including Henry Morrison and some
outsiders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad you&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; said the
farmer. &#8220;And I hope he don&#8217;t get away from
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t get away,&#8221; answered Mr. Dale.</p>
<p>&#8220;The women of this district have been afraid
to go out alone,&#8221; went on Henry Morrison.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll be glad to know he&#8217;s been captured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to let the Pooles know right
away,&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy Doctor Clay will send a telegram,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
answered Mr. Dale. &#8220;And in the meanwhile
we&#8217;ll have to take the prisoner to the Oakdale
lockup.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when the crowd reached Oak
Hall. The wild man had but little to say. His
capture had evidently broken his spirit, and he
was inclined to cry. But when Doctor Clay asked
him if he would like to have something to eat, he
brightened up wonderfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a sad case,&#8221; said the master of the Hall.
&#8220;But under proper treatment I think he can be
cured.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news quickly circulated throughout the
school that the wild man had been caught and that
he was Wilbur Poole, an uncle to Nat, and all the
boys were anxious to catch a sight of the strange
individual. The teachers and servants were likewise
curious, and looked at him as he ate his
dinner in a corner of the dining-hall, surrounded
by those who had captured him and who were
watching, to see that he did not get away. He was
not allowed to use a knife and fork, but his food
was cut up for him and served with a spoon.</p>
<p>The only person at Oak Hall who did not come
in to see the wild man was Job Haskers. When
asked about this, the dictatorial teacher shrugged
his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the boys are wild enough for me,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I want nothing to do with the insane.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is a sad case,&#8221; said the teacher who was
addressing Job Haskers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many just as bad,&#8221; responded the
other, coldly. &#8220;It is up to the Poole family to
look after that man and see that he doesn&#8217;t break
out again.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was decided to take the wild man down to
Oakdale in the school carryall, to be driven by
Horsehair. Mr. Dale was to go along, and so
were Phil, Dave, Ben, Buster, and Doctor
Clay.</p>
<p>The carryall was brought around to the side
entrance of the school, and Wilbur Poole was told
that he was about to take a ride through the country.
He walked through the hallway willingly
enough, but suddenly, on turning a corner, set up
a shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;You! you! I have found you at last!&#8221; he
cried, rushing forward. &#8220;You are the one who
exposed me! Base soldier that you are! You
have ruined the whole army!&#8221; And in a sudden
fit of passion he ran up to Job Haskers and caught
him by the throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Le&mdash;let g-g-go!&#8221; gasped the teacher, and
tried to shake the man off. Then the others ran
up, and Wilbur Poole was dragged back and handcuffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that man?&#8221; asked Dave, struck
by a sudden idea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! yes!&#8221; groaned the wild man. &#8220;He exposed
me! The army is lost!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did he expose you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He saw me do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blow up the fort-hotel. Oh, what a base villain
he was to look on!&#8221; groaned the wild man,
and suddenly commenced to weep.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;man talking about?&#8221;
stammered Job Haskers, and all saw him turn
pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says you saw him blow up Sparr&#8217;s place,&#8221;
said Dave, pointedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is false, absurd!&#8221; said the teacher. &#8220;I&mdash;er&mdash;I
never saw the rascal before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t a rascal, Mr. Haskers. He is
simply out of his mind,&#8221; remonstrated Mr.
Dale. &#8220;He is not accountable for his actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he ought not to say such things,&#8221; returned
the dictatorial teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw me&mdash;you know you did!&#8221; cried Wilbur
Poole. &#8220;You spoiled everything! I might
have blown up many forts if it hadn&#8217;t been for
you!&#8221; And he shook his head dolefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him away,&#8221; said the teacher, and turned
his back on the wild man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave, I think the wild man speaks the
truth!&#8221; whispered Phil to our hero.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly, Phil. I think the matter will bear
investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if old Haskers saw the thing done, why
didn&#8217;t he tell about it. Do you think that letter&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It struck me that such might be the truth,
Phil. But don&#8217;t say anything until you are sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was down on us&mdash;ever since we mentioned
that affair with the Widow Breen,&#8221; went
on the shipowner&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see that letter Jason Sparr got&mdash;saying
we were guilty,&#8221; returned our hero.
&#8220;Maybe Doctor Clay can get hold of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the way to Oakdale the boys spoke of the
case in whispers. Phil was quite sure Job Haskers
had seen Wilbur Poole blow up the hotel and
equally sure that the dictatorial teacher had written
the letter to the hotel-keeper stating he, Dave,
and their chums were guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought we&#8217;d be locked up, or at least that
we&#8217;d be sent away from the school and he would
be rid of us,&#8221; said Phil. &#8220;He is growing afraid
of us! Oh, if we can prove that he did it, I&#8217;ll
make it hot for him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he did such a thing as that, he ought to
be discharged from Oak Hall,&#8221; was Ben&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get my father to sue him for damages,&#8221;
put in Buster.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t be hasty,&#8221; advised Dave.
&#8220;There may be some mistake&mdash;although I think
not.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Oakdale, Wilbur Poole was turned over to
the authorities, who placed him in a comfortable
room attached to the lockup. As it was known
that he was insane, he could not be counted a
criminal, and the majority of the people pitied
him and hoped that some day he would be restored
to his right mind.</p>
<p>A telegram was sent to the Poole family, and
the next day came a reply that some men would
come to take Wilbur Poole away to a sanitarium.
It was established beyond a doubt that he had
used the dynamite to blow up the dining-room of
Sparr&#8217;s hotel, and, consequently, our hero and his
chums were cleared of that charge, much to their
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if Nat will come back?&#8221; said
Shadow. &#8220;I should think he would hate to
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he will,&#8221; said Luke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do if he does come back,
Phil?&#8221; asked Gus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Gus. Of course, I&#8217;ll let him
know what I think of him for spoiling my plans
for a spread. But I hate to be hard on him, because
of this disgrace about his uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a terrible thing,&#8221; was Chip Macklin&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
comment. &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to have a crazy man
in my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, such things can&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; put in
Polly Vane. &#8220;The Poole family will have to
make the best of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was several days later when Nat Poole
showed himself. Phil and Dave did not see him
until later, and both were struck by the change in
his appearance. He looked haggard and much
older, and his arrogance was completely gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got back, eh?&#8221; said Phil, walking up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the money-lender&#8217;s son, and
his voice sounded hollow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have they done with your uncle, Nat?&#8221;
asked Dave, kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put him in another sanitarium, where he will
have the best of care and doctoring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he gets well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We all hope that.&#8221; Nat swallowed a lump
in his throat and then looked gloomily at Phil.
&#8220;Well, you got the best of me,&#8221; he said, shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How the best of you?&#8221; demanded the shipowner&#8217;s
son.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand you found out about that
spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll pay for the damage done&mdash;as soon
as I get the money. I haven&#8217;t any now&mdash;Dad&#8217;s got
too much to pay on Uncle Wilbur&#8217;s account.&#8221; Nat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
swallowed another lump in his throat. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry I did it now, Phil, honest I am,&#8221; he went on,
brokenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s the case, let us drop the matter,
Nat,&#8221; was the instant reply. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
in hitting a fellow when he is down. You
haven&#8217;t got to pay me anything. The whole thing
is past and gone,&mdash;and that ends it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; Nat wanted to say something
more, but his voice suddenly broke and he turned
away to hide his emotion, and then walked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hit and hit hard,&#8221; said Roger, in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you did well to drop that matter, Phil,&#8221;
added Dave. &#8220;Maybe Nat has learned a lesson
he won&#8217;t easily forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave was right about the lesson Nat Poole
had learned. He was deeply humiliated, both
by the exposure concerning the feast and by what
had been learned concerning his insane uncle, and
for a long time was quite another boy.</p>
<p>It may be added here that at a new sanitarium,
and under first-class medical treatment, a marked
change came over Wilbur Poole, and in less than a
year he was completely cured of his weakmindedness.
With a nurse as a companion he went into
the country to rest both body and mind, and later
on came out into the world again as well as anybody.
Strange to say, he remembered nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
of calling himself the King of Sumatra, nor of
blowing up Jason Sparr&#8217;s hotel. But others did
not forget about the blowing up, and the damage
done had to be settled for by Mr. Aaron Poole,
who was his brother&#8217;s guardian and manager of
his estate for the time being.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>A BIT OF EVIDENCE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dave, what do you make of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to tell the truth, Phil, I don&#8217;t think
much of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think it is a clew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather faint, I must confess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think there is anything to it,&#8221; declared
Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something, but not a great deal,&#8221;
came from Roger. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you are going
to follow it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>This talk between the boys occurred after Dave,
Phil, Ben, Roger, and Buster had called upon
Jason Sparr and the justice and insisted on seeing
the letter the hotel man had received which stated
that the boys were guilty of blowing up the dining-room
of his hostelry.</p>
<p>The hotel man had treated them kindly, for he
was in dread that the boys would get their folks
to sue him for damages. He had offered to pay
back the money taken from Phil for the spread,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
and the shipowner&#8217;s son had taken the amount, to
which he was justly entitled.</p>
<p>The examination of the letter had revealed
next to nothing. It was evidently written in a
disguised hand, but some of the letters looked
like Job Haskers&#8217;s handwriting. In the corner of
the paper some sort of an advertisement had been
torn off, only the letters, &#8220;<i>blisher</i>&#8221; showing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think those letters are part of the word,
&#8216;<i>Publisher</i>,&#8217;&#8221; Dave had said. &#8220;This letter was
evidently penned by somebody who used some
publisher&#8217;s blank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Job Haskers had those blanks,&#8221; Phil
had exclaimed. &#8220;Remember, he said he published
or was going to publish something once
upon a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys talked it over, but could reach no
conclusion. Jason Sparr told how the letter had
come to him, but this added no new light on the
subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was a nasty trick, no matter who
played it,&#8221; said Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t rest until I find out who did it,&#8221; retorted
Phil.</p>
<p>All were resolved to watch Job Haskers and
also Nat Poole. But while doing this they had to
turn once more to their studies. Phil, Ben, and
Buster had to work harder than ever, and so did
Dave, to make up for the time lost during their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
absence. But Doctor Clay was kind to them, and
for once Job Haskers did not say anything, although
he showed that he expected them to &#8220;toe
the mark,&#8221; as Roger expressed it.</p>
<p>Several weeks slipped by, and during that time
Oak Hall played several games of ball. One
game of importance was won, and this was celebrated
in a befitting manner. Dave attended the
games, and so did Phil and Roger, but none of
the three allowed the sport to interfere with their
studies. All were &#8220;in the grind,&#8221; and resolved
to graduate that coming June with the highest
possible honors.</p>
<p>During those days Dave received many letters
from home. His folks and friends were glad to
know that the wild man had been captured and
the mystery of the blowing up cleared away. Jessie
sent him a very warm letter in particular, congratulating
him for bringing back the runaways,
and saying she hoped he would have no more
trouble during the final term at Oak Hall. She
added that she and all the others expected to
come to the school at graduation exercises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it is up to me to make good,&#8221; said Dave,
after reading this letter several times. &#8220;Dad
expects it, and Jessie, and everybody, and I am
not going to disappoint them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was no light task to remain at the top of
the senior class, or even near it, for there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
bright seniors in plenty, including the studious
Polly Vane, who seemed the brightest of all. But
Dave plugged away, day after day, resolved to
keep at it until the very last. He was writing on
his theme and had it about half finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;One month more and it will all be over but
the shouting,&#8221; said Roger one day, as he came into
the room where Dave was studying.</p>
<p>&#8220;All over but the shouting or weeping,&#8221; returned
Phil, who was present. &#8220;I am afraid some
of the fellows will do more weeping than cheering,&#8221;
he added, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hope that everybody passes,&#8221; said
Dave, looking up with a quiet smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a thing has never been done,&#8221; said Ben.
&#8220;Somebody is bound to drop by the wayside&mdash;I
hope it isn&#8217;t yours truly,&#8221; and he sank his head
again into his book.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think old Haskers is commencing to tighten
the screws again,&#8221; said Buster. &#8220;He let up for a
while, after the wild man was caught, but yesterday
and to-day&mdash;phew! we caught it, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We sure did!&#8221; cried Phil. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand
that man. Why is he a teacher when he
just naturally hates boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a conundrum that can&#8217;t be answered,&#8221;
said the senator&#8217;s son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t weep on leaving him,&#8221; remarked
Luke, dryly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that puts me in mind of a story,&#8221; said
Shadow. &#8220;Once on a time a man in an auto ran
into a boy carrying a cat in a basket. He didn&#8217;t
hurt the boy much but he killed the cat. Says he,
&#8216;I am sorry, my boy, and I&#8217;ll pay you for the
cat. How much?&#8217; &#8216;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; blubbered
the boy. &#8216;Will two dollars do?&#8217; asked the
man. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; says the boy, and took the money.
&#8216;Were you taking the cat home?&#8217; asked the man,
when he was ready to drive on. &#8216;No,&#8217; said the
boy. &#8216;I was going to take him down to the
canal and drown him!&#8217;&#8221; And there was a smile
over Shadow&#8217;s yarn.</p>
<p>It had been a blustery day, and as night came
on the wind increased in violence, until it fairly
howled around Oak Hall. It tore through the
branches of the oaks that gave the place its name,
until it looked as if some of the trees might be
broken off by the fury of the elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious! I never saw such a wind!&#8221; cried
Roger, as he came in from a trip to the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be fierce at sea,&#8221; returned Dave, who
was with him. &#8220;I am glad I am on shore. The
newspapers will tell about wrecks along the coast
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody thought of going out that evening, and
the boys put in the time studying and reading.
The windows rattled, and occasionally a shutter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
banged, and a good night&#8217;s rest seemed out of the
question.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, what a night for a fire!&#8221; remarked Phil,
while he and his chums were undressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention such a thing!&#8221; returned Ben,
with a shiver. &#8220;It would burn down everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>At last the boys retired. A few dropped off
to sleep, but Dave was not one of them. He had
studied hard and was restless, and the fury of the
elements added to his nervousness.</p>
<p>At last he could stand it no longer to remain in
bed, and got up to sit in an easy-chair for awhile.</p>
<p>He was just crossing the dormitory floor when
there came an extra heavy blast of wind outside,
followed by a crash, as one of the giant oaks
standing close to the school building was broken
off near the top. Then came another crash, a
jingling of glass, and a sudden wild cry for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, something&#8217;s gone through a window!&#8221;
Dave muttered. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s in the next room!&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran to the window and looked out. Just
below the window-sill he saw some branches of the
broken tree. He looked down and noted that the
tree-top had gone into the window of the room
below.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the row?&#8221; cried Roger, springing up
and rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the roof caving in?&#8221; asked Phil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some tree-branches came down and went
through the window right below us,&#8221; answered
Dave. &#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>All did so, and heard the cry for help repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Job Haskers calling!&#8221; said the senator&#8217;s
son. &#8220;He uses the room below us now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see if he is hurt,&#8221; suggested another
of the boys.</p>
<p>Clad in their pajamas, the boys flocked out
into the hallway, there to be joined by others.
Word was passed around of what had occurred,
and all made their way to the door of the instructor&#8217;s
apartment. They heard him yelling
for help with all his might.</p>
<p>The door was locked, and Dave and some
others put their shoulders to the barrier and
forced it open. All was dark in the room, and
the wind was rushing around, sending books, pictures,
and other things in all directions.</p>
<p>Several matches were struck, and at last a sheltered
light was lit. Doctor Clay, Mr. Dale, and
some of the other teachers had now arrived, and
instructors and students gazed curiously at the
scene before them.</p>
<p>The top of the tree had come straight through
the big window of the apartment, crashing down
on a bureau and a writing-desk, smashing both
flat. Some branches of the tree rested on the
side of the bed, pinning Job Haskers against the
wall, as if in a cage.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Help me! Save me!&#8221; spluttered the terror-stricken
teacher. &#8220;I am being crushed to
death!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All hands to the tree!&#8221; shouted Mr. Dale,
and showed what he meant. Boys and men took
hold of the tree-branches and pulled them to one
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you much hurt, Mr. Haskers?&#8221; asked
Doctor Clay, kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, I think so!&#8221; gasped the
teacher. His face was white and he was shivering
from fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you crawl under the branches?&#8221; asked
Mr. Dale. &#8220;Here, come this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He showed how it could be done, and trembling
from head to feet, the scared teacher got out from
under the tree-top. His face and one shoulder
were scratched, but otherwise he appeared to be
unhurt. But all were forced to acknowledge that
he had had a narrow escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better take one of the spare rooms,
Mr. Haskers,&#8221; said Doctor Clay, as another
blast of wind swept through the room. &#8220;You
cannot remain here, with this tree-top in the room.
And I am afraid we shall have to saw it up to get
it out again. You can be thankful that your life
has been spared.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The furniture is smashed!&#8221; murmured the
teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the furniture, so long as you are
not hurt. It can be mended, and all the window
needs is some new sash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My things have been scattered,&#8221; grumbled
the teacher. &#8220;A perfect mess!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave it until morning&mdash;you can do nothing
to-night,&#8221; said the doctor; and so it was finally
decided, and teachers and pupils trooped off to bed.
The broken-in door was closed, but it could not
be locked.</p>
<p>The boys had scarcely gotten back to the dormitories
when Dave called Phil, Ben, Roger, and
Buster to one side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is our chance,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Did
you notice that the bureau and the writing-desk in
Haskers&#8217;s room were smashed? It may not be the
most honorable thing to do, but I think we are
justified in looking his things over and seeing if
we can&#8217;t find some clew to that letter Jason Sparr
received.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221; declared Phil, promptly, and
the others said practically the same.</p>
<p>They waited until the other boys had retired
once more, and then, at a signal from Dave, all
filed silently into the hallway again and tiptoed
their way to the room below. Soon, they
were inside and had the light lit, and also a lantern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
which belonged to Ben&#8217;s bicycle, and which
he had chanced to have on hand.</p>
<p>Silently and with great care the boys went over
the many things that had been scattered over the
floor&mdash;wearing apparel, books, pads, papers, and
various articles of more or less value. Presently
Phil gave a low cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at this!&#8221; And he held up several sheets
of paper. In one corner were the words:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>LATIN MADE EASY<br /></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'><i>JOB HASKERS, Publisher,</i><br /></p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Albany, N. Y.</span><br /></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same paper!&#8221; cried Dave. &#8220;He
tore the corner off so that just the letters &#8216;<i>blisher</i>&#8217;
remained.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty good evidence,&#8221; said Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say it was!&#8221; cried Ben. &#8220;Wonder
what he will have to say about it, when we confront
him with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us look for more evidence, while we are
at it,&#8221; came from Buster. And then the midnight
search continued.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE EXPOSURE&mdash;GOOD-BY TO OAK HALL</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Clay, we must see you about something
that is very important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus spoke Dave, the next morning, as he and
his chums filed into the doctor&#8217;s private office
after the opening of the school. Job Haskers
was not at his class, but in his room, straightening
out his things, while some men had been sent up,
to get rid of the tree-top and repair the window.
The storm was a thing of the past, and no other
damage of importance had been done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, boys,&#8221; returned the master of the
school, kindly. &#8220;Come in and let me know what
it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The students came in, rather awkwardly it must
be admitted, for they had much on their minds
and did not know just how the worthy doctor
would take it. But they had decided on a course
of action, and they had given their word to stick
together to the end. Dave, as the natural leader,
had been chosen spokesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Clay, we want to bring up a subject of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
great importance,&#8221; said Dave. &#8220;Important to
us, and to you, and to the whole school. The
boys have asked me to speak for them and for
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; demanded the master, somewhat
shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;About Mr. Haskers and how he has treated
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he done now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t what he has done now, Doctor Clay,
it is what he did some time ago&mdash;did his best to
get us into grave trouble,&#8221; answered Dave,
warmly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll remember the letter Mr. Sparr
got, stating we were guilty of trying to blow up
his hotel. We are now satisfied that Mr. Haskers
penned that letter&mdash;in fact, we have the evidence
to prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, it is true, and I dare him to deny it.
It is an absolute fact, Doctor Clay, and we have
come here this morning to inform you that we
can no longer attend a school where he is a
teacher,&#8221; went on Dave, firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but you&mdash;er&mdash;you astound me, Porter!
Tell me what you know, or think you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a plain, straightforward manner Dave mentioned
the letter and the printing that had appeared
on it. Then he told how he and his chums
had searched the bedroom after the tree-top crash
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
and found the sheets of paper with that same printing,
and he produced them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we also found these, in a corner of the
broken writing-desk,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Some writing
by Mr. Haskers, in which he practiced backhand.
This writing is just like that which appears
in the letter Mr. Sparr got. Compare the two and
you will see we are right. Wilbur Poole said Mr.
Haskers saw him blow up the hotel, and he told
the truth, even if he is weak-minded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should Mr. Haskers do such an outrageous
thing?&#8221; asked the master of Oak Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you why, sir,&#8221; returned Dave, and
related the affair of the Widow Breen. &#8220;That
made him very sore on us, and he wanted to get
us out of the school. At first he tried it by overworking
us in our lessons, and when he found
that that didn&#8217;t work he tried this game of making
out that we were criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;but would a teacher of mine stoop
so low?&#8221; murmured the worthy doctor, shaking
his head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;No ordinary teacher would, Dr. Clay. But
Mr. Haskers is not an ordinary man&mdash;he is very
dictatorial and harsh, and he hates boys even
though he has to teach them. He isn&#8217;t a bit like
Mr. Dale, or the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never had any trouble with any teacher
but Haskers,&#8221; put in Phil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And if we have to leave Oak Hall I&#8217;m going
to get my father to sue Haskers for damages,&#8221;
added Roger.</p>
<p>A talk lasting the best part of an hour followed,
and at last the worthy doctor had his eyes opened
to the unworthiness of his assistant. He scanned
the sheets of paper and the writing the boys had
brought with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right&mdash;this is Mr. Haskers&#8217;s hand,&#8221;
he said, slowly. &#8220;But is it the same hand that
wrote that villainous letter to Mr. Sparr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Compare the two and you will see that we are
right,&#8221; answered Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; answered the doctor; and a little
later he set off for Oakdale in his buggy, going
alone.</p>
<p>The boys walked down to the gymnasium, resolved
to keep out of all classes until the matter
had been settled. They had impressed it on Doctor
Clay&#8217;s mind that either Job Haskers must
leave the school or they would do so.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when the master of Oak
Hall came back, driving slowly and looking very
thoughtful. The boys met him at the entrance
to the grounds and he told them to come to the
office, and closed the door carefully behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right,&#8221; he said, almost brokenly.
&#8220;I have been deceived by this&mdash;this&mdash;I do not
know what to call him! It will make a great stir
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
when the truth is known&mdash;and it will hurt the
school,&#8221; he added, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we make a stir about it?&#8221; asked
Dave, quickly. &#8220;Let him go, that is all we ask.
He can resign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the truth must come out,&#8221; was the firm
reply. &#8220;He shall not shelter himself behind you,
even for the benefit of the school. I have already
told the authorities the facts in the case. If they
wish to arrest him they can do so, and you may
appear against him, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When will you tell him?&#8221; asked Phil, as there
came a brief pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;At once! And I wish you to be present and
hear what is said,&#8221; returned Doctor Clay. He
rang a bell and a servant appeared. &#8220;Tell Mr.
Haskers to come here immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence after this, the boys not knowing
what to say, and the master of the school being
busy with his thoughts. Presently the door
opened and Job Haskers came in, with a look of
curiosity on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sent for me, Doctor?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, Mr. Haskers,&#8221; was the cold reply. &#8220;I
want your resignation, and I want it at once!&#8221;</p>
<p>The master of Oak Hall had gotten to his feet
and the two men stood facing each other. Doctor
Clay had his jaw set, and never had the students
seen him look so determined. He was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
longer a kindly schoolmaster, he was a judge, and
a stern judge at that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you want my resignation?&#8221; faltered
Job Haskers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you are not fit to teach here&mdash;you are
not fit to teach anywhere!&#8221; thundered the doctor.
&#8220;I want your resignation, and then I want you to
leave just as soon as you possibly can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;I want you to explain. I
want&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not necessary for me to explain, Haskers.
You have been found out. You are a despicable
villain, and you ought to be in jail. I
trusted you, and you have deceived me. More
than that, you have tried to get these young gentlemen
into serious trouble. Don&#8217;t deny it, for it
will do no good. We have the absolute proof
against you, and those proofs are also in the hands
of the law. If you don&#8217;t want to be arrested, you
will leave this school as soon as you can get your
baggage packed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I want you to know&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; commenced Job
Haskers, but stopped short, for Doctor Clay had
taken a stride forward and was shaking a finger in
the teacher&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not argue with you, Haskers. For a
long time I have not been satisfied with your work,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
for you did not seem to have the students&#8217; interest
at heart. You have a good education. But a
teacher must have more than that&mdash;he must have
a heart for his work. Now you are found out,
and I want nothing more to do with you. I will
give you a check for what is due you up to to-day,
and you will sign a receipt in full, and also your
resignation, and then I never want to see or hear
of you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose I won&#8217;t resign?&#8221; snarled the
teacher. &#8220;I have a contract&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t get out, you&#8217;ll go to jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll sue you,&#8221; Dave could not help putting
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;ll push the case as far as the
law allows,&#8221; added Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! you think you are smart, but you don&#8217;t
know it all,&#8221; snarled the teacher, but his manner
showed his uneasiness. He attempted to argue,
but Doctor Clay would not listen, and when he
said he would send for a constable, Job Haskers
quickly capitulated, signed his resignation, took his
check, and hurried away to pack his baggage. He
left about an hour later, by the back way, so that
none of the students saw him go. An hour after
that a man came for his trunks and bags; and that
was the last seen or heard of him at Oak Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Dave, when the affair was
at an end. &#8220;How glad I am that Haskers is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
gone! I feel as if a weight had been taken from
my head!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess everybody will be glad,&#8221; returned
Roger, and he was right. Some of the students
wanted to get up a celebration in honor of the
unpopular teacher&#8217;s departure, but this was not
permitted. But the boys had a time on the quiet,
and thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
<p>With the going away of Job Haskers, and the
clearing up of the mystery surrounding the letter,
Oak Hall settled down once more to its normal
condition. Another teacher came to take the
place of the man who had left, and he proved
popular all around, and made Doctor Clay wonder
why he had not made a change long before.</p>
<p>With their minds free from worry, Dave and
his chums buckled down to their lessons, and our
hero spent much time over his paper on &#8220;The
Future of Our Country.&#8221; Soon the examinations
started, and then the boys fell to worrying over
how they would fare in this final test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope I pass,&#8221; remarked Phil, when
the last examination was over. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect
to be near the top. I lost too much, going to
Cave Island, and when I ran away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me for the passing mark, too,&#8221; chimed in
Ben.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am hoping for something better,&#8221; said
Roger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What about you, Dave?&#8221; queried Buster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am like Roger, hoping for something better,&#8221;
answered our hero, with a smile. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m prepared to take what comes,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>At last came the day when the announcements
were to be made. Dave had sent in his theme
and he expected to hear from this as well as from
his studies. In the meantime, preparations were
going forward for the graduation exercises, and
visitors were expected from far and near.
Nearly all the folks from Crumville were coming,
and also the parents of Phil, Roger, and the other
seniors.</p>
<p>The big assembly room was crowded when the
announcements were made. The passing mark
was seventy-five per cent., and many of the boys
dreaded to think that they might be below that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will read the names in the order of merit,&#8221;
said Doctor Clay, after the opening exercises.
&#8220;Only two boys have failed to pass for graduation,
and they will be conditioned, if they so desire.
I am proud of the record.&#8221; And then the
master of the school proceeded to read the list.
Polly Vane and Dave had each ninety-six per cent.,
Roger had ninety-four, Shadow ninety, Sam and
Luke each eighty-eight, Phil eighty-seven, Gus
eighty-six, and so on down to Buster, who
squeezed through with seventy-eight. The boys
who had failed to pass were Nat Poole, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
only sixty-eight, and one of his cronies, who was
marked sixty-nine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t fair! I did as well as lots of &#8217;em,&#8221;
said Nat, when the reading was over. But nobody
listened to him, for all knew that the examinations
had been just in every particular.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will now announce the prizes for the best
themes on the subject, &#8216;The Future of Our Country,&#8217;&#8221;
went on Doctor Clay. &#8220;The reading of
the nine papers handed in has afforded me great
pleasure, for all are good and many of them excellent.
But I think the best of all is that written
by David Porter, and the committee of teachers
who have examined the papers agree with me.
Porter, I congratulate you, and I will now ask you
to come forward and read your meritorious composition
to your fellow-students.&#8221;</p>
<p>And amid a general handclapping our hero
went to the platform and commenced to read the
theme. Everybody listened with close attention,
and loud was the applause when he had concluded.
It was certainly a fine paper, and later on
Doctor Clay had it published in one of the school
journals, where it attracted not a little attention.</p>
<p>Dave was certainly happy and he had good reason
to be. He sent word home that night of how
he had fared and the next day received several
messages of congratulation. One message from
Jessie he prized very highly, for she wrote, &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
deserve a big hug for coming through so finely.
My very best wishes.&#8221; The other boys also got
congratulations; and that night and the night to
follow were &#8220;bonfire nights,&#8221; in more ways than
one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are rid of Haskers, and also Merwell
and Jasniff,&#8221; remarked Roger to Dave.
&#8220;We ought to be happy, eh, Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and especially over coming out so well
for graduation,&#8221; answered Dave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we&#8217;ll ever see Haskers or Merwell
again?&#8221; questioned Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I trust not,&#8221; answered our
hero. But his wish was not fulfilled. He did
meet the pair, and in a most unexpected fashion,
as will be related in the next volume of this series,
to be called &#8220;Dave Porter in the Gold Fields; or,
The Search for the Landslide Mine,&#8221; in which we
will learn how Dave went West with some of his
chums, and joined an old prospector in a hunt for
a lost mine that had been willed to Roger Morr&#8217;s
mother.</p>
<p>The graduation exercises at Oak Hall that year
formed a gala event long to be remembered. The
school and the campus were crowded, and Dave
and his chums surprised even Doctor Clay by
&#8220;chipping in&#8221; and hiring a brass band to play
outside, after the exercises were over. The boys
also presented their teachers and the master with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
some volumes of history and poetry, and received
numerous gifts in return. From his father Dave
got a bank-book, with an amount written therein
that was a complete surprise. His sister gave him
a neat stickpin and his uncle a set of books,
and from Jessie and her folks came a desk set, of
solid silver, suitably engraved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think I ought to be the happiest boy
alive,&#8221; said Dave, after the exercises were over,
and he had his diploma, tied with a broad ribbon.
&#8220;I feel just as if I was walking on air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am glad, too,&#8221; said his sister Laura,
warmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all glad,&#8221; put in Jessie, and gave him
her brightest smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad and proud, Dave,&#8221; said his father.
&#8220;My boy, you have done very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then the whole party went down to the
gymnasium, where refreshments were being served
to the visitors. And here let us leave Dave Porter,
wishing him well.</p>
